# Prepare data for modeling with Azure Machine Learning
 
Data preparation is an important part of a machine learning workflow. Your models will be more accurate and efficient if they have access to clean data in a format that is easier to consume. 

You can prepare your data in Python using the [Azure Machine Learning Data Prep SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/dataprep?view=azure-dataprep-py). 

## Data preparation pipeline

The main data preparation steps are:

1. [Load data](how-to-load-data.md), which can be in various formats
2. [Transform](how-to-transform-data.md) it into a more usable structure
3. [Write](how-to-write-data.md)  that data to a location accessible to your models
