# Link ExpressRoute circuits to enable ExpressRoute Global Reach (Preview)

ExpressRoute is a private and resilient way to connect your on-premises networks to Microsoft Cloud. You can access many Microsoft cloud services such as Azure, Office 365, and Dynamics 365 from your private data center or your corporate network. For example, you may have a branch office in San Francisco with an ExpressRoute circuit in Silicon Valley and another branch office in Baltimore with an ExpressRoute circuit in Washington DC. 

Both branch offices can have high speed connectivity to Azure resources in both East US and West US.However, the branch offices cannot exchange data directly with each other. In other words, 10.0.1.0/24 can exchange data with 10.0.3.0/24 and 10.0.4.0/24, but NOT with 10.0.2.0/24.

With **ExpressRoute Global Reach**, you can link ExpressRoute circuits together to make a private data network between your on-premises networks. In the above example, with the addition of ExpressRoute Global Reach, your San Francisco office (10.0.1.0/24) can directly exchange data with your Baltimore office (10.0.2.0/24) through the existing ExpressRoute circuits and via Microsoft's global network.

ExpressRoute Global Reach currently is supported in the following countries:

* United States
* United Kingdom 
* Japan

Your ExpressRoute circuits must be created at the [ExpressRoute peering locations](expressroute-locations.md) in the above countries. To enable ExpressRoute Global Reach between [different geopolitical regions](expressroute-locations.md), your circuits must be Premium SKU.


## Before you begin

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This public preview is provided without a service level agreement and should not be used for production workloads. Certain features may not be supported, may have constrained capabilities, or may not be available in all Azure locations. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for details.
>

Before you start configuration, you need to check the following requirements.

* Install the latest version of Azure PowerShell. See [Install and configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps).
* Understand the ExpressRoute circuit provisioning [workflows](expressroute-workflows.md).
* Make sure your ExpressRoute circuits are in Provisioned state.
* Make sure Azure private peering is configured on your ExpressRoute circuits.  

### Log into your Azure account
To start the configuration, you must log into your Azure account. 

Open your PowerShell console with elevated privileges, and connect to your account. The command will prompt you for the login credential for your Azure account.  

```powershell
Connect-AzureRmAccount
```

If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, check the subscriptions for the account.

```powershell
Get-AzureRmSubscription
```

Specify the subscription that you want to use.

```powershell
Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName "Replace_with_your_subscription_name"
```

### Identify your ExpressRoute circuits for configuration
You can enable ExpressRoute Global Reach between any two ExpressRoute circuits as long as they're located in the supported countries and they're created at different peering locations. If your subscription owns both circuits, you can choose either circuit to run the configuration in the sections below. If the two circuits are in different Azure subscriptions, you will need authorization from one Azure subscription and pass in the authorization key when you run the configuration command in the other Azure subscription.

## To enable connectivity between your on-premises networks

Use the following commands to get circuit 1 and circuit 2. The two circuits are in the same subscription.

```powershell
$ckt_1 = Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -Name "Your_circuit_1_name" -ResourceGroupName "Your_resource_group"
$ckt_2 = Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -Name "Your_circuit_2_name" -ResourceGroupName "Your_resource_group"
```

Run the following command against circuit 1 and pass in circuit 2's private peering's ID.

Note that the private peering's Id looks like:

`/subscriptions/{your_subscription_id}/resourceGroups/{your_resource_group}/providers/Microsoft.Network/expressRouteCircuits/{your_circuit_name}/peerings/AzurePrivatePeering`


```powershell
Add-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitConnectionConfig -Name 'Your_connection_name' -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt_1 -PeerExpressRouteCircuitPeering $ckt_2.Peerings[0].Id -AddressPrefix '__.__.__.__/29'
```

The *-AddressPrefix* must be a /29 IPv4 subnet, for example "10.0.0.0/29". We will use IP addresses in this subnet to establish connectivity between the two ExpressRoute circuits. You should not use addresses in this subnet in your Azure VNets or in your on-premises networks. 


Save the configuration on circuit 1.

```powershell
Set-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt_1
```

When the previous operation is complete, you should have connectivity between your on-premises networks on both sides through your two ExpressRoute circuits.

### ExpressRoute circuits in different Azure subscriptions

If the two circuits are not in the same Azure subscription, you will need authorization. In the following configuration, authorization is generated in circuit 2's subscription and the authorization key is passed to circuit 1.

Generate an authorization key. 
```powershell
$ckt_2 = Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -Name "Your_circuit_2_name" -ResourceGroupName "Your_resource_group"
Add-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitAuthorization -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt_2 -Name "Name_for_auth_key"
Set-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt_2
```
Make a note of circuit 2's private peering's ID, as well as the authorization key.

Run the following command against circuit 1. Pass in circuit 2's private peering's ID and the authorization key

```powershell
Add-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitConnectionConfig -Name 'Your_connection_name' -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt_1 -PeerExpressRouteCircuitPeering "circuit_2_private_peering_id" -AddressPrefix '__.__.__.__/29' -AuthorizationKey '########-####-####-####-############'
```

Save the configuration on circuit 1.

```powershell
Set-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt_1
```

When the previous operations is complete, you should have connectivity between your on-premises networks on both sides through your two ExpressRoute circuits.

## To get and verify the configuration

Use the following command to verify the configuration on the circuit where the configuration was made. This example uses circuit 1 from the previous example.

```powershell
$ckt1 = Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -Name "Your_circuit_1_name" -ResourceGroupName "Your_resource_group"
```

If you simply run *$ckt1* in PowerShell, you'll see *CircuitConnectionStatus* in the output. It will tell you whether the connectivity is established, "Connected", or not, "Disconnected". 

## To disable connectivity between your on-premises networks

To disable, run the commands against the circuit where the configuration was made. This example uses circuit 1 from previous examples.

```powershell
$ckt1 = Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -Name "Your_circuit_1_name" -ResourceGroupName "Your_resource_group"
Remove-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitConnectionConfig -Name "Your_connection_name" -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt_1
Set-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt_1
```

You can run the Get operation to verify the status. 

After the above operation is complete, you will no longer have connectivity between your on-premises network through your ExpressRoute circuits.
