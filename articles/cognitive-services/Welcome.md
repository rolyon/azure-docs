# What are Azure Cognitive Services?

Azure Cognitive Services are APIs, SDKs, and services available to help developers build intelligent applications without having direct AI or data science skills or knowledge. Azure Cognitive Services expand on Microsoft’s evolving portfolio of machine learning APIs and enable developers to easily add cognitive features – such as emotion and video detection; facial, speech, and vision recognition; and speech and language understanding – into their applications. The goal of Azure Cognitive Services is to help developers create applications that can see, hear, speak, understand, and even begin to reason. The catalog of services within Azure Cognitive Services can be categorized into five main pillars - Vision, Speech, Language, Search, and Knowledge.

## Use free trials

[Signing up for free trials] (https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/ "Sign-up Help") only takes an email and a few simple steps. You need a Microsoft Account if you don't already have one. You'll receive a unique pair of keys for each API requested. The second one is just a spare. Don't share the secret keys with anyone. Trials have both a rate limit, transactions per second or minute, and a monthly usage cap. A transaction is simply an API call. You can upgrade to paid tiers to unlock the restrictions.

## Subscription management

Once you are signed in with your Microsoft Account, you can access [My subscriptions] (https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/subscriptions "My subscriptions") to show the products you are using, the quota remaining, and the ability to add additional products to your subscription.

## Upgrade to unlock limits

All APIs have a free trial plan.  As paid offerings become available for each API, you'll be directed to the Azure portal to complete the purchase.  You can find *Buy* links in your Subscriptions page if you're already using them or you can skip trial altogether and purchase with provided links on [Pricing](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/pricing "pricing").  You'll need to set up an Azure subscriber account with a credit card and a phone number. If you have a special requirement or simply want to talk to sales, click "Contact us" button at the top the pricing page.

## Regional availability

The APIs in Cognitive Services are hosted on a growing network of Microsoft-managed data centers. You can find the regional availability for each API in [Azure region list](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions).
