# Call Bing Custom Search endpoint (Python)

This quickstart shows how to request search results from your custom search instance using Python to call the Bing Custom Search endpoint. 

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart, you need:

- A ready-to-use custom search instance. See [Create your first Bing Custom Search instance](quick-start.md).
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed.
- A subscription key. You can get a subscription key when you activate your [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=bing-custom-search), or you can use a paid subscription key from your Azure dashboard (see [Cognitive Services API account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account)).    


## Run the code

To run this example, follow these steps:

1. Create a folder for your code.  
  
2. From an administrator command prompt or terminal, navigate to the folder you just created.  
  
3. Install the **requests** python module:  
  
    <pre>
    pip install pipenv
    pipenv install requests
    </pre>  
      
4. Create a file named BingCustomSearch.py in the folder you created and copy the following code into it. Replace **YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY** and **YOUR-CUSTOM-CONFIG-ID** with your subscriptioin key and configuration ID.  
  
    ``` Python
    import json
    import requests
    
    subscriptionKey = "YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY"
    customConfigId = "YOUR-CUSTOM-CONFIG-ID"
    searchTerm = "microsoft"
    
    url = 'https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bingcustomsearch/v7.0/search?q=' + searchTerm + '&customconfig=' + customConfigId
    r = requests.get(url, headers={'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscriptionKey})
    print(r.text)
    ```  
  
7. Run the code using the following command.  
  
    ```
    python BingCustomSearch.py
    ```
