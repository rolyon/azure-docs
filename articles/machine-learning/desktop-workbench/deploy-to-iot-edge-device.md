# Deploy an Azure Machine Learning model to an Azure IoT Edge device

Azure Machine Learning models can be containerized as Docker-based web services. Azure IoT Edge enables you to deploy containers remotely onto devices. Use these services together to run your models at the edge for faster response times and less data transfer. 

Additional scripts and instructions can be found in the [AI Toolkit for Azure IoT Edge](http://aka.ms/AI-toolkit).

## Operationalize the model

Azure IoT Edge modules are based on container images. To deploy your Machine Learning model to an IoT Edge device, you need to create a Docker image.

Operationalize your model by following the instructions in [Azure Machine Learning Model Management Web Service Deployment](model-management-service-deploy.md) to create a Docker image with your model.

## Deploy to Azure IoT Edge

Once you have the image of your model, you can deploy it to any Azure IoT Edge device. All Machine Learning models can run on IoT Edge devices. 

### Set up an IoT Edge device

Use the Azure IoT Edge documentation to prepare a device. 

1. [Register a device with Azure IoT Hub](../../iot-edge/how-to-register-device-portal.md). The output of this processes is a connection string that you can use to configure your physical device. 
2. Install the IoT Edge runtime on your physical device, and configure it with a connection string. You can install the runtime on [Windows](../../iot-edge/how-to-install-iot-edge-windows-with-windows.md) or [Linux](../../iot-edge/how-to-install-iot-edge-linux.md) devices.  


### Find the Machine Learning container image location
You need the location of your Machine Learning container image. To find the container image location:

1. Log into the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com/).
2. In the **Azure Container Registry**, select the registry you wish to inspect.
3. In the registry, click **Repositories** to see a list of all the repositories and their images.

While you're looking at your container registry in the Azure portal, retrieve the container registry credentials. These credentials need to be given to the IoT Edge device so that it can pull the image from your private registry. 

1. In the container registry, click **Access keys**. 
2. **Enable** the admin user, if it isn't already. 
3. Save the values for **Login server**, **Username**, and **password**. 

### Deploy the container image to your device

With the container image and the container registry credentials, you're ready to deploy the machine learning model to your IoT Edge device. 

Follow the instructions in [Deploy IoT Edge modules from the Azure portal](../../iot-edge/how-to-deploy-modules-portal.md) to launch your model on your IoT Edge device.
