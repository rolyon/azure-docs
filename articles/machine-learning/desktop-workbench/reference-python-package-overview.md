# Python packages for Azure Machine Learning

[!INCLUDE [workbench-deprecated](../../../includes/aml-deprecating-preview-2017.md)] 

Learn about the proprietary Python packages from Microsoft for Azure Machine Learning (Preview). You can use these libraries and functions in combination with other open-source or third-party packages, but to use the proprietary packages, your Python code must run against a service or on a computer that provides the interpreters.

The Azure Machine Learning packages are **Python pip-installable extensions for Azure Machine Learning** that enable data scientists and AI developers to quickly build and deploy highly accurate machine learning and deep learning models for various domains.
