# Describing images

Computer Vision's algorithms analyze the content in an image. This analysis forms the foundation for a 'description' displayed as human-readable language in complete sentences. The description summarizes what is found in the image. Computer Vision's algorithms generate various descriptions based on the visual features identified in the image. Each description is evaluated and a confidence score generated. A list is then returned ordered from highest confidence score to lowest.

## Image description example

The following JSON response illustrates what Computer Vision returns when describing the example image based on its visual features.

![B&W Buildings](./Images/bw_buildings.png)

```json
{
    "description": {
        "tags": ["outdoor", "building", "photo", "city", "white", "black", "large", "sitting", "old", "water", "skyscraper", "many", "boat", "river", "group", "street", "people", "field", "tall", "bird", "standing"],
        "captions": [
            {
                "text": "a black and white photo of a city",
                "confidence": 0.95301952483304808
            },
            {
                "text": "a black and white photo of a large city",
                "confidence": 0.94085190563213816
            },
            {
                "text": "a large white building in a city",
                "confidence": 0.93108362931954824
            }
        ]
    },
    "requestId": "b20bfc83-fb25-4b8d-a3f8-b2a1f084b159",
    "metadata": {
        "height": 300,
        "width": 239,
        "format": "Jpeg"
    }
}
```

An example of a bot that uses this technology to generate image captions can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/CSharp/intelligence-ImageCaption).
