# Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) with Azure Security Center

Azure Security Center is extending its Cloud Workload Protection Platforms (CWPP) offering by integrating with [Windows Defender ATP](https://www.microsoft.com/WindowsForBusiness/windows-atp).
This change brings comprehensive Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) capabilities. It enables you to spot abnormalities, detect, and respond to advanced attacks on server endpoints monitored by ASC.

Azure Security Center customers can now use Windows Defender ATP's features:

- **Next-gen post breach detection sensors:** Windows Defender ATP sensor for Windows Servers that collects a vast array of behavioral signals to enable advanced attack detection and investigation.

- **Analytics-based, cloud-powered post breach detection:** Windows Defender ATP quickly adapts to changing threats. It employs advanced analytics and big-data. It is amplified by the power of the Intelligent Security Graph with signals across Windows, Azure, and Office to detect unknown threats. It provides actionable alerts and enables you to respond quickly.

- **Threat intelligence**: Windows Defender ATP identifies attacker tools, techniques, and procedures, and generates alerts when these are observed. It uses data generated by Microsoft hunters, security teams, and augmented by threat intelligence provided by partners.

These capabilities are now available in Azure Security Center:

- Automated onboarding - Windows Defender ATP sensor is automatically enabled on Windows Servers that are onboarded to ASC

- Single pane of glass in ASC - Windows Defender ATP alerts are available in the ASC console

- Detailed machine investigation - ASC customers can access Windows Defender ATP console to perform detailed investigation to uncover scope of breach

You can [investigate](security-center-investigation.md) the alert in Azure Security Center:

You can further investigate the alert by pivoting to Windows Defender ATP. There you can see additional information such as alert process tree, incident graph, and a detailed machine timeline exposing all of the behaviors for a historical period of up to six months.

## Platform support

This feature supports detection on Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016.

Only servers in subscriptions in Standard tier

## Onboarding instructions

To view if Windows Defender ATP integration is enabled, you can select Security center > Security policy > Subscription > Edit settings

  ![Viewing the policy](media/security-center-wdatp/policy-management.png)

Here you can see the integrations currently enabled

  ![Enabled integrations](media/security-center-wdatp/enable-integrations.png)

- If you already onboarded the servers to ASC standard tier - no action required, ASC will automatically onboard the servers to WDATP. This may take up to 24 hours.

- If you never onboarded the servers to ASC standard tier – onboard to ASC as usual.

- If you onboarded the servers through WDATP:
  - Refer to the documentation for guidance on [how to offboard server machines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=852906).
  - Onboard to ASC

## Access to WDATP portal

Follow the instructions on [Assign user access to the portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-atp/assign-portal-access-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection)

## Set firewall configuration

If you have a proxy or firewall that is blocking anonymous traffic, as Windows Defender ATP sensor is connecting from system context, make sure anonymous traffic is permitted; follow instructions [Enable access to Windows Defender ATP service URLs in the proxy server](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-atp/configure-proxy-internet-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection#enable-access-to-windows-defender-atp-service-urls-in-the-proxy-server)

## How can I test the feature?

 The following steps will generate a benign WDATP test alert.

1. RDP into one of the Windows Server VMs (2012R2 or 2016) in the subscription and open a Command Prompt window

2. At the prompt, copy and run the command below. The command Prompt window will close automatically.

    **powershell.exe -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://127.0.0.1/1.exe',
   'C:\\test-WDATP-test\\invoice.exe'); Start-Process
    'C:\\test-WDATP-test\\invoice.exe' **

  ![image of the command above in a command prompt window](media/security-center-wdatp/image4.jpeg)

3. If successful, a new alert will appear in a few minutes in ASC and WD ATP portal.

4. Review the alert in Azure Security Center, go to **Security Alerts -\>  Suspicious Powershell CommandLine**

5. From the investigation window click on the link to redirect to WDATP portal
