# Hybrid identity and Microsoft's identity solutions
Today, businesses and corporations are a becoming more and more a mixture of on-premises and cloud applications.  Having applications and users who require access to those applications, on-premises and in the cloud, has become a challenging scenario.

Microsoftâ€™s identity solutions span on-premises and cloud-based capabilities, creating a single user identity for authentication and authorization to all resources, regardless of location. We call this hybrid identity.

## What is Azure AD Connect?

Azure AD Connect is the Microsoft tool designed to meet and accomplish your hybrid identity goals.  This allows you to provide a common identity for your users for Office 365, Azure, and SaaS applications integrated with Azure AD.  It provides the following features:
 	
- [Synchronization](how-to-connect-sync-whatis.md) - This component is responsible for creating users, groups, and other objects. It is also responsible for making sure identity information for your on-premises users and groups is matching the cloud.  It is responsible for synchronizing password hashes with Azure AD.
-  	[AD FS and federation integration](how-to-connect-fed-whatis.md) - Federation is an optional part of Azure AD Connect and can be used to configure a hybrid environment using an on-premises AD FS infrastructure. It also provides AD FS management capabilities such as certificate renew and additional AD FS server deployments.
-  	[Pass-through Authentication](how-to-connect-pta.md) - Another optional component that allows users to use the same password on-premises and in the cloud, but doesn't require the additional infrastructure of a federated environment
-  	[Health Monitoring](whatis-hybrid-identity-health.md) - Azure AD Connect Health can provide robust monitoring and provide a central location in the Azure portal to view this activity.

## What is Azure AD Connect Health?

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Connect Health helps you monitor and gain insights into your on-premises identity infrastructure and the synchronization services. It enables you to maintain a reliable connection to Office 365 and Microsoft Online Services by providing monitoring capabilities for your key identity components such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) servers, Azure AD Connect servers (also known as Sync Engine), Active Directory domain controllers, etc. It also makes the key data points about these components easily accessible so that you can get usage and other important insights to make informed decisions.

The information is presented in the [Azure AD Connect Health portal](https://aka.ms/aadconnecthealth). In the Azure AD Connect Health portal, you can view alerts, performance monitoring, usage analytics, and other information. Azure AD Connect Health enables the single lens of health for your key identity components in one place.

As the features in Azure AD Connect Health increase, the portal provides a single dashboard through the lens of identity. You get an even more robust, healthy, and integrated environment for your users to increase their ability to get things done.


## Why use Azure AD Connect?
Integrating your on-premises directories with Azure AD makes your users more productive by providing a common identity for accessing both cloud and on-premises resources. Users and organizations can take advantage of the following:

* Users can use a single identity to access on-premises applications and cloud services such as Office 365.
* Single tool to provide an easy deployment experience for synchronization and sign-in.
* Provides the newest capabilities for your scenarios. Azure AD Connect replaces older versions of identity integration tools such as DirSync and Azure AD Sync. For more information, see [Hybrid Identity directory integration tools comparison](plan-hybrid-identity-design-considerations-tools-comparison.md).

## Why use Azure AD Connect Health?
When you integrate your on-premises directories with Azure AD, your users are more productive because there's a common identity to access both cloud and on-premises resources. However, this integration creates the challenge of ensuring that this environment is healthy so that users can reliably access resources both on premises and in the cloud from any device. Azure AD Connect Health helps you monitor and gain insights into your on-premises identity infrastructure that is used to access Office 365 or other Azure AD applications. It is as simple as installing an agent on each of your on-premises identity servers.
