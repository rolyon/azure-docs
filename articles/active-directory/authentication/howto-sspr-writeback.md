# How-to: Configure password writeback

We recommend that you use the auto-update feature of [Azure AD Connect](../hybrid/how-to-connect-install-express.md) when using password writeback.

The following steps assume you have already configured Azure AD Connect in your environment by using the [Express](../hybrid/how-to-connect-install-express.md) or [Custom](../hybrid/how-to-connect-install-custom.md) settings.

1. To configure and enable password writeback, sign in to your Azure AD Connect server and start the **Azure AD Connect** configuration wizard.
2. On the **Welcome** page, select **Configure**.
3. On the **Additional tasks** page, select **Customize synchronization options**, and then select **Next**.
4. On the **Connect to Azure AD** page, enter a global administrator credential, and then select **Next**.
5. On the **Connect directories** and **Domain/OU** filtering pages, select **Next**.
6. On the **Optional features** page, select the box next to **Password writeback** and select **Next**.

7. On the **Ready to configure** page, select **Configure** and wait for the process to finish.
8. When you see the configuration finish, select **Exit**.

For common troubleshooting tasks related to password writeback, see the section [Troubleshoot password writeback](active-directory-passwords-troubleshoot.md#troubleshoot-password-writeback) in our troubleshooting article.

## Active Directory permissions

The account specified in the Azure AD Connect utility must have the following items set if you want to be in scope for SSPR:

* **Reset password** 
* **Change password** 
* **Write permissions** on `lockoutTime`
* **Write permissions** on `pwdLastSet`
* **Extended rights** on either:
   * The root object of *each domain* in that forest
   * The user organizational units (OUs) you want to be in scope for SSPR

If you're not sure what account the described account refers to, open the Azure Active Directory Connect configuration UI and select the **View current configuration** option. The account that you need to add permission to is listed under **Synchronized Directories**.

If you set these permissions, the MA service account for each forest can manage passwords on behalf of the user accounts within that forest. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you neglect to assign these permissions, then, even though writeback appears to be configured correctly, users will encounter errors when they attempt to manage their on-premises passwords from the cloud.
>

> [!NOTE]
> It might take up to an hour or more for these permissions to replicate to all the objects in your directory.
>

To set up the appropriate permissions for password writeback to occur, complete the following steps:

1. Open Active Directory Users and Computers with an account that has the appropriate domain administration permissions.
2. From the **View** menu, make sure **Advanced features** is turned on.
3. In the left panel, right-click the object that represents the root of the domain and select **Properties** > **Security** > **Advanced**.
4. From the **Permissions** tab, select **Add**.
5. Pick the account that permissions are being applied to (from the Azure AD Connect setup).
6. In the **Applies to** drop-down list, select **Descendent user** objects.
7. Under **Permissions**, select the boxes for the following:
    * **Reset password**
    * **Change password**
    * **Write lockoutTime**
    * **Write pwdLastSet**
8. Select **Apply/OK** to apply the changes and exit any open dialog boxes.
