# Install applications with Helm in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

[Helm][helm] is an open-source packaging tool that helps you install and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes applications. Similar to Linux package managers such as *APT* and *Yum*, Helm is used to manage Kubernetes charts, which are packages of preconfigured Kubernetes resources.

This article shows you how to configure and use Helm in a Kubernetes cluster on AKS.

## Before you begin

The steps detailed in this document assume that you have created an AKS cluster and have established a `kubectl` connection with the cluster. If you need these items see, the [AKS quickstart][aks-quickstart].

## Install Helm CLI

The Helm CLI is a client that runs on your development system and allows you to start, stop, and manage applications with Helm.

If you use the Azure Cloud Shell, the Helm CLI is already installed. To install the Helm CLI on a Mac, use `brew`. For additional installation options see, [Installing Helm][helm-install-options].

```console
brew install kubernetes-helm
```

Output:

```

## Create a service account

Before you can deploy Helm in an RBAC-enabled cluster, you need a service account and role binding for the Tiller service. For more information on securing Helm / Tiller in an RBAC enabled cluster, see [Tiller, Namespaces, and RBAC][tiller-rbac]. If your cluster is not RBAC enabled, skip this step.

Create a file named `helm-rbac.yaml` and copy in the following YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: tiller
  namespace: kube-system
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: tiller
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: tiller
    namespace: kube-system
```

Create the service account and role binding with the `kubectl create` command:

```console
kubectl create -f helm-rbac.yaml
```

## Secure Tiller and Helm

The Helm client and Tiller service authenticate and communicate with each other using TLS/SSL. This authentication method helps to secure the Kubernetes cluster and what services can be deployed. To improve security, you can generate your own signed certificates. Each Helm user would receive their own client certificate, and Tiller would be initialized in the Kubernetes cluster with certificates applied. For more information, see [Using TLS/SSL between Helm and Tiller][helm-ssl].

With an RBAC-enabled Kubernetes cluster, you can control the level of access Tiller has to the cluster. You can define the Kubernetes namespace that Tiller is deployed in, and restrict what namespaces Tiller can then deploy resources in. This approach lets you create Tiller instances in different namespaces and limit deployment boundaries, and scope the users of Helm client to certain namespaces. For more information, see [Helm role-based access controls][helm-rbac].

## Configure Helm

To deploy a basic Tiller into an AKS cluster, use the [helm init][helm-init] command. If your cluster is not RBAC enabled, remove the `--service-account` argument and value. If you configured TLS/SSL for Tiller and Helm, skip this basic initialization step and instead provide the required `--tiller-tls-` as shown in the next example.

```console
helm init --service-account tiller
```

If you configured TLS/SSL between Helm and Tiller provide the `--tiller-tls-` parameters and names of your own certificates, as shown in the following example:

```console
helm init \
    --tiller-tls \
    --tiller-tls-cert tiller.cert.pem \
    --tiller-tls-key tiller.key.pem \
    --tiller-tls-verify \
    --tls-ca-cert ca.cert.pem \
    --service-account tiller
```

## Find Helm charts

Helm charts are used to deploy applications into a Kubernetes cluster. To search for pre-created Helm charts, use the [helm search][helm-search] command:

```console
helm search
```

The following condensed example output shows some of the Helm charts available for use:

```
$ helm search

```

To update the list of charts, use the [helm repo update][helm-repo-update] command. The following example shows a successful repo update:

```console
$ helm repo update

Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Skip local chart repository
...Successfully got an update from the "stable" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈ Happy Helming!⎈
```

## Run Helm charts

To install charts with Helm, use the [helm install][helm-install] command and specify the name of the chart to install. To see this in action, let's install a basic Wordpress deployment using a Helm chart. If you configured TLS/SSL, add the `--tls` parameter to use your Helm client certificate.

```console
helm install stable/wordpress
```

The following condensed example output shows the deployment status of the Kubernetes resources created by the Helm chart:

```
$ helm install stable/wordpress

NAME:   wishful-mastiff

==> v1beta1/StatefulSet

==> v1/PersistentVolumeClaim

wishful-mastiff-wordpress  Pending  default  2s

==> v1/Service
NAME                       TYPE          CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP  PORT(S)                     AGE
wishful-mastiff-mariadb    ClusterIP     10.1.116.54  <none>       3306/TCP                    2s
wishful-mastiff-wordpress  LoadBalancer  10.1.217.64  <pending>    80:31751/TCP,443:31264/TCP  2s
...
```

It takes a minute or two for the *EXTERNAL-IP* address of the Wordpress service to be populated and allow you to access it with a web browser.

## List Helm releases

To see a list of releases installed on your cluster, use the [helm list][helm-list] command. The following example shows the Wordpress release deployed in the previous step. If you configured TLS/SSL, add the `--tls` parameter to use your Helm client certificate.

```console
$ helm list

NAME             REVISION	 UPDATED                 	 STATUS  	 CHART          	NAMESPACE
wishful-mastiff  1       	 Thu Jul 12 15:53:56 2018	 DEPLOYED	 wordpress-2.1.3  default
```
