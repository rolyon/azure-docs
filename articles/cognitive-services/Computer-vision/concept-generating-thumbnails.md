# Generating thumbnails

A thumbnail is a small representation of a full-size image. Varied devices such as phones, tablets, and PCs create a need for different user experience (UX) layouts and thumbnail sizes. Using smart cropping, this Computer Vision feature helps solve the problem.

After uploading an image, Computer Vision generates a high-quality thumbnail and then analyzes the objects within the image to identify the *region of interest* (ROI). It can optionally crop the image to fit the requirements of the ROI. The generated thumbnail can be presented using an aspect ratio that is different from the aspect ratio of the original image, to accommodate your needs.

The thumbnail algorithm works as follows:

1. Removes distracting elements from the image and identifies the main object, the region of interest.
2. Crops the image based on the identified region of interest.
3. Changes the aspect ratio to fit the target thumbnail dimensions.

The generated thumbnail can vary widely depending on what you specify for height, width, and smart cropping, as shown in the following image.

## Thumbnail generation examples

The following table illustrates typical thumbnails generated by Computer Vision for the example images. The thumbnails were generated for a specified target height and width of 50 pixels, with smart cropping enabled.
