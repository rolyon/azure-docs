# Azure Data Box Gateway system requirements (Preview)

This article describes the important system requirements for your Microsoft Azure Data Box Gateway solution and for the clients connecting to Azure Data Box Gateway. We recommend that you review the information carefully before you deploy your Data Box Gateway, and then refer back to it as necessary during the deployment and subsequent operation.

The system requirements for the Data Box Gateway virtual device include:

- **Software requirements for hosts** - describes the supported platforms, browsers for the local configuration UI, SMB clients, and any additional requirements for the hosts that connect to the device.
- **Networking requirements for the device** - provides information about any networking requirements for the operation of the virtual device.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Data Box Gateway is in Preview. Please review the [terms of use for the preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) before you deploy this solution.

## Networking requirements

The following table lists the ports that need to be opened in your firewall to allow for SMB, cloud, or management traffic. In this table, *in* or *inbound* refers to the direction from which incoming client requests access to your device. *Out* or *outbound* refers to the direction in which your Data Box Gateway device sends data externally, beyond the deployment: for example, outbound to the Internet.

| Port no.|	In or out |	Port scope|	Required|	Notes                                                             |                                                                                     |
|--------|---------|----------|--------------|----------------------|---------------|
| TCP 80 (HTTP)|Out|WAN	|No|Outbound port is used for Internet access to retrieve updates. <br>The outbound web proxy is user configurable. |                          
| TCP 443 (HTTPS)|Out|WAN|Yes|Outbound port is used for accessing data in the cloud.<br>The outbound web proxy is user configurable.|   
| UDP 53 (DNS)|Out|WAN|In some cases<br>See notes|This port is required only if you are using an Internet-based DNS server.<br>We recommend using local DNS server. |
| UDP 123 (NTP)|Out|WAN|In some cases<br>See notes|This port is required only if you are using an Internet-based NTP server.  |
| UDP 67 (DHCP)|Out|WAN|In some cases<br>See notes|This port is required only if you are using a DHCP server.  |
| TCP 80 (HTTP)|In|LAN|Yes|This is the inbound port for local UI on the device for local management. <br>Accessing the local UI over HTTP will automatically redirect to HTTPS.  | 
| TCP 443 (HTTPS)|In|LAN|Yes|This is the inbound port for local UI on the device for local management. | 

## URL patterns for firewall rules

Network administrators can often configure advanced firewall rules based on the URL patterns to filter the inbound and the outbound traffic. Your Data Box Gateway device and the Data Box Gateway service depend on other Microsoft applications such as Azure Service Bus, Azure Active Directory Access Control, storage accounts, and Microsoft Update servers. The URL patterns associated with these applications can be used to configure firewall rules. It is important to understand that the URL patterns associated with these applications can change. This in turn will require the network administrator to monitor and update firewall rules for your Data Box Gateway as and when needed.

We recommend that you set your firewall rules for outbound traffic, based on Data Box Gateway fixed IP addresses, liberally in most cases. However, you can use the information below to set advanced firewall rules that are needed to create secure environments.

> [!NOTE]
> - The device (source) IPs should always be set to all the cloud-enabled network interfaces.
> - The destination IPs should be set to [Azure datacenter IP ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/download/confirmation.aspx?id=41653).

## Internet bandwidth

The following requirements apply to minimum Internet bandwidth available for your Data Box Gateway devices.

- Your Data Box Gateway has a dedicated 20 Mbps Internet bandwidth (or more) available at all times. This bandwidth should not be shared with any other applications. 
- Your Data Box Gateway has a dedicated 32 Mbps Internet bandwidth (or more) when using network throttling.
