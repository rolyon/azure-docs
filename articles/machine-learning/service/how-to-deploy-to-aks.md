# How to deploy models from Azure Machine Learning service to Azure Kubernetes Service

For high-scale production scenarios, you can deploy your model to the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Azure Machine Learning can use an existing AKS cluster or a new cluster created during deployment. The model is deployed to ASK as a web service.

Deploying to AKS provides auto-scaling, logging, model data collection, and fast response times for your web service.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have one, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

- An Azure Machine Learning workspace, a local directory containing your scripts, and the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python installed. Learn how to get these prerequisites using the [How to configure a development environment](how-to-configure-environment.md) document.

- A trained machine learning model. If you don't have one, see the [train image classification model](tutorial-train-models-with-aml.md) tutorial.

## Initialize the workspace

To initialize the workspace, load the `config.json` file that contains your workspace information.

```python
from azureml.coreazureml import Workspace

# Load existing workspace from the config file info.
ws = Workspace.from_config()
```

## Register the model

To register an existing model, specify the model path, description, and tags.

```python
from azureml.core.model import Model

model = Model.register(model_path = "model.pkl", # this points to a local file
                        model_name = "best_model", # this is the name the model is registered as
                        tags = {"data": "diabetes", "type": "regression"},
                        description = "Ridge regression model to predict diabetes",
                        workspace = ws)
```

## Create a Docker image

Azure Kubernetes Service uses Docker images. To create the image, use the following steps:

1. To configure the image, you must create a scoring script and environment file. For an example of creating the script and environment file, see the following sections of the image classification example:

    * [Create a scoring script (score.py)](tutorial-deploy-models-with-aml.md#create-scoring-script)

    * [Create an environment file (myenv.yml)](tutorial-deploy-models-with-aml.md#create-environment-file) 

   The following example uses these files to configure the image:

    ```python
    from azureml.core.image import ContainerImage

    # Image configuration
    image_config = ContainerImage.image_configuration(execution_script = "score.py",
                                                        runtime = "python",
                                                        conda_file = "myenv.yml",
                                                        description = "Image with ridge regression model",
                                                        tags = {"data": "diabetes", "type": "regression"}
                                                        )
    ```

1. To create the image, use the model and image configuration. This operation may take around 5 minutes to complete:

    ```python
    image = ContainerImage.create(name = "myimage1",
                                    # this is the model object
                                    models = [model],
                                    image_config = image_config,
                                    workspace = ws)

    # Wait for the create process to complete
    image.wait_for_creation(show_output = True)
    ```

## Create the AKS Cluster

The following code snippet demonstrates how to create the AKS cluster. This process takes around 20 minutes to complete:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Creating the AKS cluster is a one time process for your workspace. Once created, you can reuse this cluster for multiple deployments. If you delete the cluster or the resource group that contains it, then you must create a new cluster the next time you need to deploy.


```python
from azureml.core.compute import AksCompute, ComputeTarget

# Use the default configuration (you can also provide parameters to customize this)
prov_config = AksCompute.provisioning_configuration()

aks_name = 'aml-aks-1' 
# Create the cluster
aks_target = ComputeTarget.create(workspace = ws, 
                                    name = aks_name, 
                                    provisioning_configuration = prov_config)

# Wait for the create process to complete
aks_target.wait_for_completion(show_output = True)
print(aks_target.provisioning_state)
print(aks_target.provisioning_errors)
```

### Attach existing AKS cluster (optional)

If you have existing AKS cluster in your Azure subscription, you can use it to deploy your image. The following code snippet demonstrates how to attach a cluster to your workspace. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only AKS version 1.8.7 is supported.

```python
# Get the resource id from https://porta..azure.com -> Find your resource group -> click on the Kubernetes service -> Properties
resource_id = '/subscriptions/<your subscription id>/resourcegroups/<your resource group>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/<your aks service name>'

# Set to the name of the cluster
cluster_name='my-existing-aks' 

# Attatch the cluster to your workgroup
aks_target = AksCompute.attach(workspace=ws, name=cluster_name, resource_id=resource_id)

# Wait for the operation to complete
aks_target.wait_for_provisioning(True)
```

## Deploy your web service

The following code snippet demonstrates how to deploy the image to the AKS cluster:

```python
from azureml.core.webservice import Webservice, AksWebservice

# Set configuration and service name
aks_config = AksWebservice.deploy_configuration()
aks_service_name ='aks-service-1'
# Deploy from image
aks_service = Webservice.deploy_from_image(workspace = ws, 
                                            name = aks_service_name,
                                            image = image,
                                            deployment_config = aks_config,
                                            deployment_target = aks_target)
# Wait for the deployment to complete
aks_service.wait_for_deployment(show_output = True)
print(aks_service.state)
```

> [!TIP]
> If there are errors during deployment, use `aks_service.get_logs()` to view the AKS service logs. The logged information may indicate the cause of the error.

## Test the web service

Use `aks_service.run()` to test the web service. The following code snippet demonstrates how to pass data to the service and display the prediction:

```python
import json

test_sample = json.dumps({'data': [
    [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], 
    [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
]})
test_sample = bytes(test_sample,encoding = 'utf8')

prediction = aks_service.run(input_data = test_sample)
print(prediction)
```

## Cleanup

To delete the service, image, and model, use the following code snippet:

```python
aks_service.delete()
image.delete()
model.delete()
```
