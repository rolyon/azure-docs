# Administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory

Using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you can designate separate administrators to serve different functions. Administrators can be designated in the Azure AD portal to perform tasks such as adding or changing users, assigning administrative roles, resetting user passwords, managing user licenses, and managing domain names.

The Global Administrator has access to all administrative features. By default, the person who signs up for an Azure subscription is assigned the Global Administrator role for the directory. Only Global Administrators can delegate administrator roles.

## Assign or remove administrator roles

To learn how to assign administrative roles to a user in Azure Active Directory, see [View and assign administrator roles in Azure Active Directory](directory-manage-roles-portal.md).

## Available roles

The following administrator roles are available:

This role also grants the ability to consent to delegated permissions, and application permissions excluding Microsoft Graph and Azure AD Graph. Members of this role are not added as owners when creating new application registrations or enterprise applications.

* **[Application Developer](#application-developer)**: Users in this role can create application registrations when the "Users can register applications" setting is set to No. This role also allows members to consent on their own behalf when the "Users can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf" setting is set to No. Members of this role are added as owners when creating new application registrations or enterprise applications.
