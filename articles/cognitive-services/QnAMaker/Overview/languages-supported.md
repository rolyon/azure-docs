# Supported languages

The language of a knowledge base affects QnA Maker's ability to auto-extract questions and answers from [sources](../Concepts/data-sources-supported.md), as well as the relevance of the results QnA Maker provides in response to user queries.

## Auto extraction
QnA Maker supports question/answer extraction in any language page, but the effectiveness of the extraction is much higher for the following languages, as QnA Maker uses keywords to identify questions.

|Languages supported| Locale|
|-----|----|
|English|en-*|
|French|fr-*|
|Italian|it-*|
|German|de-*|
|Spanish|es-*|

## Query matching and relevance
QnA Maker depends on [language analyzers](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/language-support) in Azure search for providing results. Special re-ranking features are available for En-* languages that enable better relevance.

QnA Maker auto-detects the language of the knowledge base during creation and sets the analyzer accordingly. You can create knowledge bases in the following languages. Read [this](../How-To/language-knowledge-base.md) for more details about how QnA Maker handles languages.


> [!Tip]
> Language analyzers, once set, cannot be changed. Also, the language analyzer applies to all the knowledge bases in a [QnA Maker service](../How-To/set-up-qnamaker-service-azure.md). If you plan to have knowledge bases in different language, you should create them under separate QnA Maker services.
