# List of Service Fabric events 

Service Fabric exposes a primary set of cluster events to inform you of the status of your cluster as [Service Fabric Events](service-fabric-diagnostics-events.md). These are based on actions performed by Service Fabric on your nodes and your cluster or management decisions made by a cluster owner/operator. These events can be accessed by querying the [EventStore](service-fabric-diagnostics-eventstore.md) in your cluster, or through the operational channel. On Windows machines, the operational channel is also hooked up to the EventLog - so you can see Service Fabric Events in Event Viewer. 

>[!NOTE]
>For a list of Service Fabric events for clusters in versions < 6.2, please refer to the following section. 

Here is a list of all the events available in the platform, sorted by the entity that they map to.
