# Viewing and analyzing data in Log Analytics
There are two options available in the Azure portal for analyzing data stored in Log analytics and for creating queries for ad hoc analysis. The queries that you create using these portals can be used for other features such as alerts and dashboards.

## Log Analytics page
Open the Log Analytics page from **Logs** in the Log Analytics menu. This is a new experience for working with log data and creating queries. You can get an introduction to this portal and inspect its features at [Get started with the Log Analytics page in the Azure portal](query-language/get-started-analytics-portal.md).

The Log Analytics page provides the following improvements over the [Log search (classic)](#log-search-classic) experience.

* Multiple tabs – create separate tabs to work with multiple queries.
* Rich visualizations – variety of charting options.
* Improved Intellisense and language auto-completion.
* Syntax highlighting – improves readability of queries. 
* Query explorer – access saved queries and functions.
* Schema view – review the structure of your data to assist in writing queries.
* Share – create links to queries, or pin queries to any shared Azure dashboard.
* Smart Analytics - identifies spikes in your charts and a quick analysis of the cause.
* Column selection – sort and group columns in the query results.

> [!NOTE]
> The Log Analytics page has the same functionality as the Advanced Analytics portal which is an external tool outside of the Azure portal. The Advanced Analytics portal is still available, but links and other references to it in the Azure portal are being replaced with this new page.

### Resource logs
The new Log Analytics experience integrates with various Azure resources such as Virtual Machines. This means that you can open the Log Analytics page directly through the resource's monitoring menu without switching to Azure Monitor or Log Analytics and losing the resource context. **Logs** has not yet been enabled for all Azure resources, but it will start appearing in the portal menu for different resources types.

When opening Log Analytics from a specific resource, it's automatically scoped to log records of that resource only.   If you want to write a query that includes other records, then you would need to open it from the Log Analytics or Azure Monitor menu.

The following options are not yet available through the resource view of Log Analytics:

- Save
- Set alert
- Query explorer
- Switching to different workspace/resource (currently not planned)


### Firewall requirements
Your browser requires access to the following addresses to access the Log Analytics page and the Advanced Analytics portal.  If your browser is accessing the Azure portal through a firewall, you must enable access to these addresses.

| Uri | IP | Ports |
|:---|:---|:---|
| portal.loganalytics.io | Dynamic | 80,443 |
| api.loganalytics.io    | Dynamic | 80,443 |
| docs.loganalytics.io   | Dynamic | 80,443 |


## Log search (classic)
Open the Log search page from **Logs (Classic)** in the Log Analytics menu or from **Log Analytics** in the Azure Monitor menu. This is the classic page used for working with Log Analytics queries that lacks the additional the features of the [Log Analytics page](#log-analytics-page) listed above.

## Next steps

- Walk through a [tutorial using Log Search](log-analytics-tutorial-viewdata.md) to learn how to create queries using the query language
- Walk through a [lesson using the Advanced Analytics portal](query-language/get-started-analytics-portal.md) which provides the same experience as the Log Analytics page.
