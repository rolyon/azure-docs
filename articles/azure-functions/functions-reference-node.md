# Azure Functions JavaScript developer guide
This guide contains information about the intricacies of writing Azure Functions with JavaScript.

A JavaScript function is an exported `function` that will execute when triggered ([triggers are configured in function.json](functions-triggers-bindings.md)). Each function is passed a `context` object which is used for receiving and sending binding data, logging, and communicating with the runtime.

This article assumes that you have already read the [Azure Functions developer reference](functions-reference.md). It is also recommended that you have followed a tutorial under "Quickstarts" to [create your first function](functions-create-first-function-vs-code.md).

## Folder structure

The required folder structure for a JavaScript project looks like the following. Note that this default can be changed: see the [scriptFile](functions-reference-node.md#using-scriptfile) section below for more details.

```
FunctionsProject
 | - MyFirstFunction
 | | - index.js
 | | - function.json
 | - MySecondFunction
 | | - index.js
 | | - function.json
 | - SharedCode
 | | - myFirstHelperFunction.js
 | | - mySecondHelperFunction.js
 | - node_modules
 | - host.json
 | - package.json
 | - extensions.csproj
 | - bin
```

At the root of the project, there's a shared [host.json](functions-host-json.md) file that can be used to configure the function app. Each function has a folder with its own code file (.js) and binding configuration file (function.json).

The binding extensions required in [version 2.x](functions-versions.md) of the Functions runtime are defined in the `extensions.csproj` file, with the actual library files in the `bin` folder. When developing locally, you must [register binding extensions](functions-triggers-bindings.md#local-development-azure-functions-core-tools). When developing functions in the Azure portal, this registration is done for you.

## Exporting a function

JavaScript functions must be exported via [`module.exports`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_exports) (or [`exports`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_exports)). In the default case, your exported function should be the only export from its file, the export named `run`, or the export named `index`. The default location of your function is `index.js`, where `index.js` shares the same parent directory as the corresponding `function.json`. Note that the name of `function.json`'s parent directory is always the name of your function. 

To configure the file location and export name of your function, read about [configuring your function's entry point](functions-reference-node.md#configure-function-entry-point) below.

Your exported function entry point must always take a `context` object as the first parameter.

```javascript
// You must include a context, other arguments are optional
module.exports = function(context, myTrigger, myInput, myOtherInput) {
    // function logic goes here :)
    context.done();
};
// You can also use 'arguments' to dynamically handle inputs
module.exports = async function(context) {
    context.log('Number of inputs: ' + arguments.length);
    // Iterates through trigger and input binding data
    for (i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++){
        context.log(arguments[i]);
    }
};
```

Triggers and input bindings (bindings of `direction === "in"`) can be passed to the function as parameters. They are passed to the function in the same order that they are defined in *function.json*. You can also dynamically handle inputs using the JavaScript [`arguments`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/87dw3w1k.aspx) object. For example, if you have `function(context, a, b)` and change it to `function(context, a)`, you can still get the value of `b` in function code by referring to `arguments[2]`.

All bindings, regardless of direction, are also passed along on the `context` object using the `context.bindings` property.

## context object
The runtime uses a `context` object to pass data to and from your function and to let you communicate with the runtime.

The `context` object is always the first parameter to a function and must be included because it has methods such as `context.done` and `context.log`, which are required to use the runtime correctly. You can name the object whatever you would like (for example, `ctx` or `c`).

```javascript
// You must include a context, but other arguments are optional
module.exports = function(ctx) {
    // function logic goes here :)
    ctx.done();
};
```

### context.bindings property

```
context.bindings
```
Returns a named object that contains all your input and output data. For example, the following binding definitions in your *function.json* lets you access the contents of a queue from `context.bindings.myInput` and assign outputs to a queue using `context.bindings.myOutput`.

```json
{
    "type":"queue",
    "direction":"in",
    "name":"myInput"
    ...
},
{
    "type":"queue",
    "direction":"out",
    "name":"myOutput"
    ...
}
```

```javascript
// myInput contains the input data, which may have properties such as "name"
var author = context.bindings.myInput.name;
// Similarly, you can set your output data
context.bindings.myOutput = { 
        some_text: 'hello world', 
        a_number: 1 };
```

Note that you can choose to define output binding data using the `context.done` method instead of the `context.binding` object (see below).

### context.bindingData property

```
context.bindingData
```
Returns a named object that contains trigger metadata and function invocation data (`invocationId`, `sys.methodName`, `sys.utcNow`, `sys.randGuid`). For an example of trigger metadata, see this [event hubs example](functions-bindings-event-hubs.md#trigger---javascript-example).

### context.done method
```
context.done([err],[propertyBag])
```

Informs the runtime that your code has finished. If your function uses the JavaScript [`async function`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) declaration (available using Node 8+ in Functions version 2.x), you do not need to use `context.done()`. The `context.done` callback is implicitly called.

If your function is not an async function, **you must call** `context.done` to inform the runtime that your function is complete. The execution will time out if it is missing.

The `context.done` method allows you to pass back both a user-defined error to the runtime and a JSON object containing output binding data. Properties passed to `context.done` will overwrite anything set on the `context.bindings` object.

```javascript
// Even though we set myOutput to have:
//  -> text: 'hello world', number: 123
context.bindings.myOutput = { text: 'hello world', number: 123 };
// If we pass an object to the done function...
context.done(null, { myOutput: { text: 'hello there, world', noNumber: true }});
// the done method will overwrite the myOutput binding to be: 
//  -> text: 'hello there, world', noNumber: true
```

### context.log method  

```
context.log(message)
```
Allows you to write to the streaming function logs at the default trace level. On `context.log`, additional logging methods are available that let you write function logs at other trace levels:


| Method                 | Description                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **error(_message_)**   | Writes to error level logging, or lower.   |
| **warn(_message_)**    | Writes to warning level logging, or lower. |
| **info(_message_)**    | Writes to info level logging, or lower.    |
| **verbose(_message_)** | Writes to verbose level logging.           |

The following example writes a log at the warning trace level:

```javascript
context.log.warn("Something has happened."); 
```
You can [configure the trace-level threshold for logging](#configure-the-trace-level-for-console-logging) in the host.json file. For more information on writing logs, see [writing trace outputs](#writing-trace-output-to-the-console) below.

Read [monitoring Azure Functions](functions-monitoring.md) to learn more about viewing and querying function logs.

## Binding data type

To define the data type for an input binding, use the `dataType` property in the binding definition. For example, to read the content of an HTTP request in binary format, use the type `binary`:

```json
{
    "type": "httpTrigger",
    "name": "req",
    "direction": "in",
    "dataType": "binary"
}
```

Options for `dataType` are: `binary`, `stream`, and `string`.

## Writing trace output to the console 

In Functions, you use the `context.log` methods to write trace output to the console. In Functions v2.x, trace ouputs via `console.log` are captured at the Function App level. This means that outputs from `console.log` are not tied to a specific function invocation, and hence aren't displayed in a specific function's logs. They will, however, propagate to Application Insights. In Functions v1.x, you cannot use `console.log` to write to the console. 

When you call `context.log()`, your message is written to the console at the default trace level, which is the _info_ trace level. The following code writes to the console at the info trace level:

```javascript
context.log({hello: 'world'});  
```

This code is equivalent to the code above:

```javascript
context.log.info({hello: 'world'});  
```

This code writes to the console at the error level:

```javascript
context.log.error("An error has occurred.");  
```

Because _error_ is the highest trace level, this trace is written to the output at all trace levels as long as logging is enabled.

All `context.log` methods support the same parameter format that's supported by the Node.js [util.format method](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_format_format). Consider the following code, which writes function logs by using the default trace level:

```javascript
context.log('Node.js HTTP trigger function processed a request. RequestUri=' + req.originalUrl);
context.log('Request Headers = ' + JSON.stringify(req.headers));
```

You can also write the same code in the following format:

```javascript
context.log('Node.js HTTP trigger function processed a request. RequestUri=%s', req.originalUrl);
context.log('Request Headers = ', JSON.stringify(req.headers));
```

### Configure the trace level for console logging

Functions lets you define the threshold trace level for writing to the console, which makes it easy to control the way traces are written to the console from your functions. To set the threshold for all traces written to the console, use the `tracing.consoleLevel` property in the host.json file. This setting applies to all functions in your function app. The following example sets the trace threshold to enable verbose logging:

```json
{ 
    "tracing": {      
        "consoleLevel": "verbose"	  
    }
}  
```

Values of **consoleLevel** correspond to the names of the `context.log` methods. To disable all trace logging to the console, set **consoleLevel** to _off_. For more information, see [host.json reference](functions-host-json.md).

## HTTP triggers and bindings

HTTP and webhook triggers and HTTP output bindings use request and response objects to represent the HTTP messaging.  

### Request object

The `context.req` (request) object has the following properties:

| Property      | Description                                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _body_        | An object that contains the body of the request.               |
| _headers_     | An object that contains the request headers.                   |
| _method_      | The HTTP method of the request.                                |
| _originalUrl_ | The URL of the request.                                        |
| _params_      | An object that contains the routing parameters of the request. |
| _query_       | An object that contains the query parameters.                  |
| _rawBody_     | The body of the message as a string.                           |


### Response object

The `context.res` (response) object has the following properties:

| Property  | Description                                               |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| _body_    | An object that contains the body of the response.         |
| _headers_ | An object that contains the response headers.             |
| _isRaw_   | Indicates that formatting is skipped for the response.    |
| _status_  | The HTTP status code of the response.                     |

### Accessing the request and response 

When you work with HTTP triggers, you can access the HTTP request and response objects in a number of ways:

+ From `req` and `res` properties on the `context` object. In this way, you can use the conventional pattern to access HTTP data from the context object, instead of having to use the full `context.bindings.name` pattern. The following example shows how to access the `req` and `res` objects on the `context`:

    ```javascript
    // You can access your http request off the context ...
    if(context.req.body.emoji === ':pizza:') context.log('Yay!');
    // and also set your http response
    context.res = { status: 202, body: 'You successfully ordered more coffee!' }; 
    ```

+ From the named input and output bindings. In this way, the HTTP trigger and bindings work the same as any other binding. The following example sets the response object by using a named `response` binding: 

    ```json
    {
        "type": "http",
        "direction": "out",
        "name": "response"
    }
    ```
    ```javascript
    context.bindings.response = { status: 201, body: "Insert succeeded." };
    ```
+ _[Response only]_ By calling `context.res.send(body?: any)`. An HTTP response is created with input `body` as the response body. `context.done()` is implicitly called.

+ _[Response only]_ By calling `context.done()`. A special kind of HTTP binding returns the response that is passed to the `context.done()` method. The following HTTP output binding defines a `$return` output parameter:

    ```json
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "$return"
    }
    ``` 
    ```javascript
     // Define a valid response object.
    res = { status: 201, body: "Insert succeeded." };
    context.done(null, res);   
    ```  

## Node version

The following table shows the Node.js version used by each major version of the Functions runtime:

| Functions version | Node.js version | 
|---|---|
| 1.x | 6.11.2 (locked by the runtime) |
| 2.x  | _Active LTS_ and _Current_ Node.js versions (8.11.1 and 10.6.0 recommended). Set the version by using the WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION [app setting](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings).|

You can see the current version that the runtime is using by checking the above app setting or by printing `process.version` from any function.

## Dependency management
In order to use community libraries in your JavaScript code, as is shown in the below example, you need to ensure that all dependencies are installed on your Function App in Azure.

```javascript
// Import the underscore.js library
var _ = require('underscore');
var version = process.version; // version === 'v6.5.0'

module.exports = function(context) {
    // Using our imported underscore.js library
    var matched_names = _
        .where(context.bindings.myInput.names, {first: 'Carla'});
```

Note that you should define a `package.json` file at the root of your function app. Defining the file lets all functions in the app share the same cached packages, which gives the best performance. If a version conflict arises, you can resolve it by adding a `package.json` file in the folder of a specific function.  

There are two ways to install packages on your Function App: 

### Deploying with Dependencies
1. Install all requisite packages locally by running `npm install`.

2. Deploy your code, and ensure that the `node_modules` folder is included in the deployment. 


### Using Kudu
1. Go to `https://<function_app_name>.scm.azurewebsites.net`.

2. Click **Debug Console** > **CMD**.

3. Go to `D:\home\site\wwwroot`, and then drag your package.json file to the **wwwroot** folder at the top half of the page.  
    You can upload files to your function app in other ways also. For more information, see [How to update function app files](functions-reference.md#fileupdate). 

4. After the package.json file is uploaded, run the `npm install` command in the **Kudu remote execution console**.  
    This action downloads the packages indicated in the package.json file and restarts the function app.

## Environment variables
To get an environment variable or an app setting value, use `process.env`, as shown here in the `GetEnvironmentVariable` function:

```javascript
module.exports = function (context, myTimer) {
    var timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();

    context.log('Node.js timer trigger function ran!', timeStamp);   
    context.log(GetEnvironmentVariable("AzureWebJobsStorage"));
    context.log(GetEnvironmentVariable("WEBSITE_SITE_NAME"));

    context.done();
};

function GetEnvironmentVariable(name)
{
    return name + ": " + process.env[name];
}
```

## Configure function entry point

The `function.json` properties `scriptFile` and `entryPoint` can be used to configure the location and name of your exported function. These can be important if your JavaScript is transpiled.

### Using `scriptFile`

By default, a JavaScript function is executed from `index.js`, a file that shares the same parent directory as its corresponding `function.json`.

`scriptFile` can be used to get a folder structure that looks like this:
```
FunctionApp
 | - host.json
 | - myNodeFunction
 | | - function.json
 | - lib
 | | - nodeFunction.js
 | - node_modules
 | | - ... packages ...
 | - package.json
```

The `function.json` for `myNodeFunction` should include a `scriptFile` property pointing to the file with the exported function to run.
```json
{
  "scriptFile": "../lib/nodeFunction.js",
  "bindings": [
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Using `entryPoint`

In `scriptFile` (or `index.js`), a function must be exported using `module.exports` in order to be found and run. By default, the function that executes when triggered is the only export from that file, the export named `run`, or the export named `index`.

This can be configured using `entryPoint` in `function.json`:
```json
{
  "entryPoint": "logFoo",
  "bindings": [
    ...
  ]
}
```

In Functions v2.x, which supports the `this` parameter in user functions, the function code could then be as follows:
```javascript
class MyObj {
    constructor() {
        this.foo = 1;
    };
    
    function logFoo(context) { 
        context.log("Foo is " + this.foo); 
        context.done(); 
    }
}

const myObj = new MyObj();
module.exports = myObj;
```

In this example, it is important to note that although an object is being exported, there are no guarantess around preserving state between executions.

## Considerations for JavaScript functions

When you work with JavaScript functions, be aware of the considerations in the following sections.

### Choose single-vCPU App Service plans

When you create a function app that uses the App Service plan, we recommend that you select a single-vCPU plan rather than a plan with multiple vCPUs. Today, Functions runs JavaScript functions more efficiently on single-vCPU VMs, and using larger VMs does not produce the expected performance improvements. When necessary, you can manually scale out by adding more single-vCPU VM instances, or you can enable auto-scale. For more information, see [Scale instance count manually or automatically](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/insights-how-to-scale.md?toc=%2fazure%2fapp-service-web%2ftoc.json).    

### TypeScript and CoffeeScript support
Because direct support does not yet exist for auto-compiling TypeScript or CoffeeScript via the runtime, such support needs to be handled outside the runtime, at deployment time. 

### Cold Start
When developing Azure Functions in the serverless hosting model, cold starts are a reality. "Cold start" refers to the fact that when your Function App starts for the first time after a period of inactivity, it will take longer to start up. For JavaScript functions with large dependency trees in particular, this can cause major slowdown. In order to hasten the process, if possible, [run your functions as a package file](run-functions-from-deployment-package.md). Many deployment methods opt into this model by default, but if you're experiencing large cold starts and are not running from a package file, this can be a massive improvement.
