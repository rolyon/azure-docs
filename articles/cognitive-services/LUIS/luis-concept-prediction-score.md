# Prediction score
A prediction score indicates the degree of confidence LUIS has for prediction results. 

A prediction score is usually between zero (0) and one (1). An example of a highly confident LUIS score is 0.99. An example of a score of low confidence is 0.01. 

|Score value|Confidence|
|--|--|
|1|definite match|
|0.99|high confidence|
|0.01|low confidence|
|0|definite failure to match|

When an utterance results in a low-confidence score, LUIS highlights that in the [LUIS](luis-reference-regions.md) website **Intent** page, with the identified **labeled-intent** outlined with red.

## Top-scoring intent
Every utterance prediction returns a top-scoring intent. This is a numerical comparison of prediction scores. The top two scores can have a very small difference between them. LUIS doesn't indicate this proximity other than returning scores.  

If you are concerned about proximity of top scores, you should return the score for all intents. You can either add utterances to the two intents that indicate their differences with word choice and arrangement or you can have the LUIS-calling application, such as a chatbot, make programmatic choices about how to handle the two top intents. 

Two intents, that are too closely scored, may invert due to nondeterministic training. The top score could become the second top and the second top score could become the first top score. In order to prevent this, add example utterances to each of the top two intents for that utterance with word choice and context that differentiates the two intents. The two intents should have about the same number of example utterances. A rule of thumb for separation to prevent inversion due to training, is a 15% difference in scores.

## Return prediction score for all intents
A test or endpoint result can include all intents. This configuration is set on the [endpoint](https://aka.ms/v1-endpoint-api-docs) with the `verbose=true` query string name/value pair. 

## Review intents with similar scores
Reviewing the score for all intents is a good way to verify that not only is the correct intent identified, but that the next identified intent's score is significantly lower consistently for utterances. 

If multiple intents have close prediction scores, based on the context of an utterance, LUIS may switch between the intents. To fix this, continue to add utterances to each intent with a wider variety of contextual differences.   

## E (exponent) notation

Prediction scores can use exponent notation, *appearing* above the 0-1 range, such as `9.910309E-07`. This score is an indication of a very **small** number.

|E notation score |Actual score|
|--|--|
|9.910309E-07|.0000009910309|

## Differences with predictions
When you train the same model in a different app, and the scores are not this same, this is because there is an element of randomness in the training. Secondly, any overlap of an utterance to more than one intent means the top intent for the same utterance can change based on training.

If your chatbot requires a specific LUIS score to indicate confidence in an intent, you should instead use the score difference between the top two intents. This provides flexibility for variations in training. 

## Punctuation
Punctuation is a separate token in LUIS. An utterance that contains a period at the end versus an utterance that does not are two separate utterances and may get two different predictions. Make sure the model handles punctuation either in the [example utterances](luis-concept-utterance.md) (having and not having punctuation) or in the [patterns}(luis-concept-patterns.md) where it is easier to ignore punctuation with the special syntax: `I am applying for the {Job} position[.]`
