> This article contains content which requires the Azure classic CLI. The current release
> of the Azure CLI does not have support for the features outlined in this article,
> so the classic CLI is required. 
> 
> The classic CLI can be installed side-by-side with the modern Azure CLI,
> but we recommend using the Azure CLI for all new scripts and deployments where feature support
> is available. To install the classic CLI, see [Install the Azure classic CLI](/cli/azure/install-classic-cli)
> and to install the current CLI, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
