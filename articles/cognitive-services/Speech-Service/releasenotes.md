# Release notes

## Cognitive Services Speech SDK 1.0.0: 2018-September release

**New features**

* Support for Objective-C on iOS. Check out our [Objective-C quickstart for iOS](quickstart-objectivec-ios.md).
* Support for JavaScript in browser. Check out our [JavaScript quickstart](quickstart-js-browser.md).

**Breaking changes**

* With this release a number of breaking changes are introduced.
  Please check [this page](https://aka.ms/csspeech/breakingchanges_1_0_0) for details.

## Cognitive Services Speech SDK 0.6.0: 2018-August release

**New features**

* UWP apps built with the Speech SDK now can pass the Windows App Certification Kit (WACK).
  Check out the [UWP quickstart](quickstart-csharp-uwp.md).
* Support for .NET Standard 2.0 on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 x64).
* Experimental: Support Java 8 on Windows (64-bit) and Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 x64).
  Check out the [Java Runtime Environment quickstart](quickstart-java-jre.md).

**Functional change**

* Expose additional error detail information on connection errors.

**Breaking changes**

* On Java (Android), the `SpeechFactory.configureNativePlatformBindingWithDefaultCertificate` function no longer requires a path parameter. Now the path is automatically detected on all supported platforms.
* The get-accessor of the property `EndpointUrl` in Java and C# was removed.

**Bug fixes**

* In Java, the audio synthesis result on the translation recognizer is implemented now.
* Fixed a bug that could cause inactive threads and an increased number of open and unused sockets.
* Fixed a problem, where a long-running recognition could terminate in the middle of the transmission.
* Fixed a race condition in recognizer shutdown.

## Cognitive Services Speech SDK 0.5.0: 2018-July release

**New features**

* Support Android platform (API 23: Android 6.0 Marshmallow or higher). Check out the [Android quickstart](quickstart-java-android.md).
* Support .NET Standard 2.0 on Windows. Check out the [.NET Core quickstart](quickstart-csharp-dotnetcore-windows.md).
* Experimental: Support UWP on Windows (version 1709 or later).
  * Check out the [UWP quickstart](quickstart-csharp-uwp.md).
  * Note: UWP apps built with the Speech SDK do not yet pass the Windows App Certification Kit (WACK).
* Support long-running recognition with automatic reconnection.

**Functional changes**

* `StartContinuousRecognitionAsync()` supports long-running recognition.
* The recognition result contains more fields. They're offset from the audio beginning and duration (both in ticks) of the recognized text and additional values that represent recognition status, for example, `InitialSilenceTimeout` and `InitialBabbleTimeout`.
* Support AuthorizationToken for creating factory instances.

**Breaking changes**

* Recognition events: NoMatch event type was merged into the Error event.
* SpeechOutputFormat in C# was renamed to OutputFormat to stay aligned with C++.
* The return type of some methods of the `AudioInputStream` interface changed slightly:
   * In Java, the `read` method now returns `long` instead of `int`.
   * In C#, the `Read` method now returns `uint` instead of `int`.
   * In C++, the `Read` and `GetFormat` methods now return `size_t` instead of `int`.
* C++: Instances of audio input streams now can be passed only as a `shared_ptr`.

**Bug fixes**

* Fixed incorrect return values in the result when `RecognizeAsync()` times out.
* The dependency on media foundation libraries on Windows was removed. The SDK now uses Core Audio APIs.
* Documentation fix: Added a [regions](regions.md) page to describe the supported regions.

**Known issue**

* The Speech SDK for Android doesn't report speech synthesis results for translation. This issue will be fixed in the next release.

## Cognitive Services Speech SDK 0.4.0: 2018-June release

**Functional changes**

- AudioInputStream

  A recognizer now can consume a stream as the audio source. For more information, see the related [how-to guide](how-to-use-audio-input-streams.md).

- Detailed output format

  When you create a `SpeechRecognizer`, you can request `Detailed` or `Simple` output format. The `DetailedSpeechRecognitionResult` contains a confidence score, recognized text, raw lexical form, normalized form, and normalized form with masked profanity.

**Breaking change**

- Changed to `SpeechRecognitionResult.Text` from `SpeechRecognitionResult.RecognizedText` in C#.

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed a possible callback issue in the USP layer during shutdown.

- If a recognizer consumed an audio input file, it was holding on to the file handle longer than necessary.

- Removed several deadlocks between the message pump and the recognizer.

- Fire a `NoMatch` result when the response from service is timed out.

- The media foundation libraries on Windows are delay loaded. This library is required for microphone input only.

- The upload speed for audio data is limited to about twice the original audio speed.

- On Windows, C# .NET assemblies now are strong named.

- Documentation fix: `Region` is required information to create a recognizer.

More samples have been added and are constantly being updated. For the latest set of samples, see the [Speech SDK samples GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/csspeech/samples).

## Cognitive Services Speech SDK 0.2.12733: 2018-May release
