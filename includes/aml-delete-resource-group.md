If you're not going to use what you've created here, delete the resources you just created with this quickstart so you don't incur any charges.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** on the far left.

1. From the list, select the resource group you created.

1. Select **Delete resource group**.

1. Type the resource group name and then select **Delete**.

   If you get the error "Can not delete resource before nested resources are deleted", you must delete any nested resources first.
