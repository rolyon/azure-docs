## Supported operating systems and drivers

### NVIDIA Tesla (CUDA) drivers

NVIDIA Tesla (CUDA) drivers for NC, NCv2, NCv3, and ND-series VMs (optional for NV-series) are supported only on the operating systems listed in the following table. Driver download links are current at time of publication. For the latest drivers, visit the [NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/) website.

> [!TIP]
> As an alternative to manual CUDA driver installation on a Windows Server VM, you can deploy an Azure [Data Science Virtual Machine](../articles/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/overview.md) image. The DSVM editions for Windows Server 2016 pre-install NVIDIA CUDA drivers, the CUDA Deep Neural Network Library, and other tools.
