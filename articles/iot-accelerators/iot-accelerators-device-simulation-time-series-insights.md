# Use Time Series Insights to visualize telemetry sent from the Device Simulation solution accelerator

The Device Simulation solution accelerator lets you generate telemetry from simulated devices to test your IoT solutions. This how-to guide shows you how to visualize and analyze the simulated telemetry using a Time Series Insights environment.

## Prerequisites

To follow the steps in this how-to guide, you need an active Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

The steps in this how-to guide assume you've deployed the Device Simulation solution accelerator to your Azure subscription. If you haven't deployed the solution accelerator, follow the steps in the [Deploy and run a cloud-based device simulation solution](quickstart-device-simulation-deploy.md) quickstart.

This article assumes the name of your solution accelerator is **contoso-simulation**. Replace **contoso-simulation** with the name of your solution accelerator as you complete the following steps.

## Start a simulation

Before you use Time Series Insights explorer, configure the Device Simulation solution accelerator to generate some telemetry. The following screenshot, shows a running simulation with 10 chiller devices:

## Time Series Insights explorer

The Time Series Insights explorer is a web app you can use to visualize your telemetry.

1. In the Azure portal, select the Time Series Insights **Overview** tab.

1. To open the Time Series Insights explorer web app, click **Go to Environment**:
