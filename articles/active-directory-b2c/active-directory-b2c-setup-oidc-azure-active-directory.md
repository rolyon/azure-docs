# Set up sign-in Azure Active Directory accounts a built-in policy in Azure Active Directory B2C

>[!NOTE]
> This feature is in public preview. Do not use the feature in production environments.

This article shows you how to enable sign-in for users from a specific Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) organization using a built-in policy in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2C.

## Create an Azure AD app

To enable sign-in for users from a specific Azure AD organization, you need to register an application within the organizational Azure AD tenant.

>[!NOTE]
>`Contoso.com` is used for the organizational Azure AD tenant and `fabrikamb2c.onmicrosoft.com` is used as the Azure AD B2C tenant in the following instructions.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Make sure you're using the directory that contains organizational Azure AD tenant (contoso.com) by clicking the **Directory and subscription filter** in the top menu and choosing the directory that contains your tenant.
3. Choose **All services** in the top-left corner of the Azure portal, and then search for and select **App registrations**.
4. Select **New application registration**.
5. Enter a name for your application. For example, `Azure AD B2C App`.
6. For the **Application type**, select `Web app / API`.
7. For the **Sign-on URL**, enter the following URL in all lowercase letters, where `your-tenant` is replaced with the name of your Azure AD B2C tenant (fabrikamb2c.onmicrosoft.com):

    ```
    https://yourtenant.b2clogin.com/your-tenant.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp
    ```

8. Click **Create**. Copy the **Application ID** to be used later.
9. Select the application, and then select **Settings**.
10. Select **Keys**, enter the key description, select a duration, and then click **Save**. Copy the value of the key that is displayed to be used later.

## Configure Azure AD as an identity provider in your tenant

1. Make sure you're using the directory that contains organizational Azure AD tenant (contoso.com) by clicking the **Directory and subscription filter** in the top menu and choosing the directory that contains your tenant.
2. Choose **All services** in the top-left corner of the Azure portal, and then search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.
3. Select **Identity providers**, and then select **Add**.
4. Enter a **Name**. For example, enter "Contoso Azure AD".
5. Select **Identity provider type**, select **Open ID Connect**, and click **OK**.
6. Click **Set up this identity provider**
7. For **Metadata url**, enter the following URL replacing `your-tenant` with the name of your Azure AD tenant. For example, contoso.com:

    ```
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/your-tenant/.well-known/openid-configuration
    ```

8. Optionally, enter a value for **Domain** (e.g. `ContosoAD`). This is the value to use when referring to this identity provider using *domain_hint* in the request. 
9. Click **OK**.
10. Select **Map this identity provider's claims** and set the following claims:
    
    - For **User ID**, enter `oid`.
    - For **Display Name**, enter `name`.
    - For **Given name**, enter `given_name`.
    - For **Surname**, enter `family_name`.
    - For **Email**, enter `unique_name`.

11. Click **OK**, and then **Create** to save your configuration.
