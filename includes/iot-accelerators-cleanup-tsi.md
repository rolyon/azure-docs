## Clean up resources

If you plan to explore further, leave the solution accelerator deployed.

If you no longer need the solution accelerator, delete it from the [Provisioned solutions](https://www.azureiotsolutions.com/Accelerators#dashboard) page, by selecting it, and then clicking **Delete Solution**.

If you added the Time Series Insights environment to the solution accelerator's resource group, it is automatically deleted when you delete the solution accelerator. Otherwise you must manually remove the Time Series Insights environment from the Azure portal.
