# Updating Azure Backup Central Reporting Content Pack 

[Azure Backup Content Pack](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-configure-reports#view-reports-in-power-bi) can be used to view reports about backup centrally. The content pack is updated regularly to add more features, and for bug fixes. This article leads you through the steps to update the Content Pack, to delay the update, and the updates that are made over time.

## How to get updates to the content pack

### To get the updated content pack
Your copy of the content pack will get updated automatically if you have not made any changes to it. 
In case the content pack has been changed, you will get a notification in PowerBI, and an email notification about the same. You can choose to get the updated content pack as per your convenience. 

### To delay the update
The best practice is to import the content pack into a [custom workspace](https://youtu.be/26zyOtyHPJM?t=1m57s). You now have the ability to edit the reports.
As mentioned above, if the content pack is changed, you see a notification in PowerBI. You can choose to get the content pack later. 

## Coming Soon
   
Azure Backup Content Pack is being updated to support more workloads, as SQL in IaaS VM backup, and SC DPM, in addition to the current support for MAB and Azure VM Backup. This means that you will soon be able to view and analyze data all your backup data at one central place. The [reports can also be customized](https://youtu.be/26zyOtyHPJM) to suit the needs of your organization.

To make the reports more meaningful across workloads, the set of reports pre-configured with Azure Backup Content Pack is being changed. A sneak peek into the upcoming set of reports is available here:
