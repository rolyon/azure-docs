# Azure Data Box system requirements

This article describes the important system requirements for your Microsoft Azure Data Box and for the clients connecting to the Data Box. We recommend that you review the information carefully before you deploy your Data Box, and then refer back to it as necessary during the deployment and subsequent operation.

The system requirements include:

* **Software requirements for hosts connecting to Data Box** - describes the supported platforms, browsers for the local web UI, SMB clients, and any additional requirements for hosts that can connect to the Data Box.
* **Networking requirements for the Data Box** - provides information about the networking requirements for the optimum operation of the Data Box.

## Networking requirements

Your datacenter needs to have high-speed network. We strongly recommend that you have at least one 10 GbE connection. If a 10 GbE connection is not available, a 1 GbE data link can be used to copy data but the copy speeds are impacted.
