# Azure Stack Managed Disks: Differences and considerations
This article summarizes the known differences between Azure Stack Managed Disks and Managed Disks for Azure. To learn about high-level differences between Azure Stack and Azure, see the [Key considerations](azure-stack-considerations.md) article.

Managed Disks simplifies disk management for IaaS VMs by managing the [storage accounts](/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-manage-storage-accounts) associated with the VM disks.

|Migration      |Provide tool to migrate from existing unmanaged Azure Resource Manager VMs without the need to recreate the VM  |Not yet supported |


## Metrics
There are also differences with storage metrics:
- With Azure Stack, the transaction data in storage metrics doesn't differentiate internal or external network bandwidth.
- Azure Stack transaction data in storage metrics doesn't include virtual machine access to the mounted disks.


## API versions
Azure Stack Managed Disks supports the following API versions:
