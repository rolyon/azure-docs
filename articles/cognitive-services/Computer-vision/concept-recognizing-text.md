# Recognizing printed and handwritten text

Computer Vision can detect and extract printed or handwritten text from images of various objects with different surfaces and backgrounds, such as receipts, posters, business cards, letters, and whiteboards.

Text recognition saves time and effort. You can be more productive by taking an image of text rather than transcribing it. Text recognition makes it possible to digitize notes. This digitization allows you to implement quick and easy search. It also reduces paper clutter.

## Text recognition requirements

Computer Vision can recognize printed and handwritten text in images that meet the following requirements:

- The image must be presented in JPEG, PNG, or BMP format
- The file size of the image must be less than 4 megabytes (MB)
- The dimensions of the image must be between 40 x 40 and 3200 x 3200 pixels
