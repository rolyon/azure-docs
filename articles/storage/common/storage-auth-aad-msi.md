# Authenticate access to blobs and queues with Azure managed identities for Azure Resources (Preview)

Azure Blob and Queue storage support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication with [managed identities for Azure resources](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md). You can use managed identities for Azure resources to authenticate access to blobs and queues from applications running in Azure virtual machines (VMs), function apps, virtual machine scale sets, and others. By using managed identities for Azure resources and leveraging the power of Azure AD authentication, you can avoid storing credentials with your applications that run in the cloud.  

To grant permissions to a managed identity to a blob container or queue, you assign a role-based access control (RBAC) role to the managed identity that encompasses permissions for that resource at the appropriate scope. For more information about RBAC roles in storage, see [Manage access rights to storage data with RBAC (Preview)](storage-auth-aad-rbac.md). 

This article shows how to authenticate to Azure Blob or Queue storage with a managed identity from an Azure VM.

## Enable managed identities on a VM

Before you can use managed identities for Azure Resources to authenticate access to blobs and queues from your VM, you must first enable managed identities for Azure Resources on the VM. To learn how to enable managed identities for Azure Resources, see one of these articles:

- [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-service-identity/qs-configure-portal-windows-vm)
- [Azure PowerShell](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-powershell-windows-vm.md)
- [Azure CLI](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-cli-windows-vm.md)
- [Azure Resource Manager Template](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-template-windows-vm.md)
- [Azure SDKs](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-sdk-windows-vm.md)

## Get a managed identity access token

To authenticate with a managed identity, your application or script must acquire a managed identity access token. To learn about how to acquire an access token, see [How to use managed identities for Azure resources on an Azure VM to acquire an access token](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-use-vm-token.md).

## .NET code example: Create a block blob

The code example assumes that you have a managed identity access token. The access token is used to authorize the managed identity to create a block blob.

### Add references and using statements  

In Visual Studio, install the preview version of the Azure Storage client library. From the **Tools** menu, select **Nuget Package Manager**, then **Package Manager Console**. Type the following command into the console:

```
Install-Package https://www.nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.Storage  
```

Add the following using statements to your code:

```dotnet
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Auth;
```

### Create credentials from the managed identity access token

To create the block blob, use the **TokenCredentials** class provided by the preview package. Construct a new instance of **TokenCredentials**, passing in the managed identity access token that you obtained previously:

```dotnet
// Create storage credentials from your managed identity access token.
TokenCredential tokenCredential = new TokenCredential(accessToken);
StorageCredentials storageCredentials = new StorageCredentials(tokenCredential);

// Create a block blob using the credentials.
CloudBlockBlob blob = new CloudBlockBlob(new Uri("https://storagesamples.blob.core.windows.net/sample-container/Blob1.txt"), storageCredentials);
``` 

> [!NOTE]
> Azure AD integration with Azure Storage requires that you use HTTPS for Azure Storage operations.
