# Subscribe to events for a resource group and filter for a resource with PowerShell

This script creates an Event Grid subscription to the events for a resource group. It uses a filter to get only events for a specified resource in the resource group.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Sample script

```powershell
# Provide an endpoint for handling the events.
$myEndpoint = "<endpoint URL>"

# Select the Azure subscription that contains the resource group.
Set-AzureRmContext -Subscription "Contoso Subscription"

# Get the resource ID to filter events
$resourceId = (Get-AzureRmResource -ResourceName demoSecurityGroup -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup).ResourceId

# Subscribe to the resource group. Provide the name of the resource group you want to subscribe to.
New-AzureRmEventGridSubscription `
  -Endpoint $myEndpoint `
  -EventSubscriptionName demoSubscriptionToResourceGroup `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -SubjectBeginsWith $resourceId
```
