## What you will learn

You learn how to use Azure IoT Toolkit extension for Visual Studio Code to monitor device-to-cloud messages and to send cloud-to-device messages. Device-to-cloud messages could be sensor data that your device collects and then sends to your IoT hub. Cloud-to-device messages could be commands that your IoT hub sends to your device to blink an LED that is connected to your device.

## What you will do

- Use Azure IoT Toolkit extension for Visual Studio Code to monitor device-to-cloud messages.
- Use Azure IoT Toolkit extension for Visual Studio Code to send cloud-to-device messages.

## What you need

- An active Azure subscription.
- An Azure IoT hub under your subscription.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Azure IoT Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-toolkit)

## Sign in to access your IoT hub

1. In **Explorer** view of VS Code, expand **Azure IoT Hub Devices** section in the bottom left corner.
1. Click **Select IoT Hub** in context menu.
1. A pop-up will show in the bottom right corner to let you sign in to Azure for the first time.
1. After you sign in, your Azure Subscription list will be shown, then select Azure Subscription and IoT Hub.
1. The device list will be shown in **Azure IoT Hub Devices** tab in a few seconds.

   > [!Note]
   > You can also complete the set up by choosing **Set IoT Hub Connection String**. Enter the connection string for the IoT hub that your IoT device connects to in the pop-up window.
   
## Monitor device-to-cloud messages

To monitor messages that are sent from your device to your IoT hub, follow these steps:

1. Right-click your device and select **Start Monitoring D2C Message**.
1. The monitored messages will be shown in **OUTPUT** > **Azure IoT Toolkit** view.
1. To stop monitoring, right-click the **OUTPUT** view and select **Stop Monitoring D2C Message**.

## Send cloud-to-device messages

To send a message from your IoT hub to your device, follow these steps:

1. Right-click your device and select **Send C2D Message to Device**. 
1. Enter the message in input box.
1. Results will be shown in **OUTPUT** > **Azure IoT Toolkit** view.

## Next steps

Youâ€™ve learned how to monitor device-to-cloud messages and send cloud-to-device messages between your IoT device and Azure IoT Hub.
