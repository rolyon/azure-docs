# How to control the hybrid Azure AD join of your devices

Hybrid Azure AD join is a process to automatically register your on-premises domain-joined devices with Azure AD. There are cases where you don't want all your devices to register automatically. This is for example true, during the initial rollout to verify that everything works as expected.

This article provides you with guidance on how you can control hybrid Azure AD join of your devices. 


## Prerequisites

This article assumes that you are familiar with:

-  [Introduction to device management in Azure Active Directory](../device-management-introduction.md)
 
-  [How to plan your hybrid Azure Active Directory join implementation](hybrid-azuread-join-plan.md)

-  Configure hybrid Azure Active Directory join for [managed domains](hybrid-azuread-join-managed-domains.md) or [federated domains](hybrid-azuread-join-federated-domains.md)



## Control Windows current devices

For devices running the Windows desktop operating system, the supported version is the Windows 10 Anniversary Update (version 1607) or later. As a best practice, upgrade to the latest version of Windows 10.

All windows current devices automatically register with Azure AD at device start or user sign-in. You can control this behavior either with a group policy object (GPO) or System Center Configuration Manager.

To control Windows current devices, you need to: 

1.	**To all devices**: Disable automatic device registration.
2.	**To selected devices**: Enable automatic device registration.

If you have verified that everything works as expected, you are ready to enable automatic device registration for all devices again.



## Group Policy Object 

You can control the device registration behavior of your devices by deploying the following GPO: **Register domain-joined computers as devices**

**To set the GPO**:

1.	Open **Server Manager**, and then go to **Tools \> Group Policy Management**.

2.	Go to the domain node that corresponds to the domain where you want to disable/enable the auto-registration.

3.	Right-click **Group Policy Objects**, and then select **New**.

4.	Type a name (for example, *Hybrid Azure AD join*) for your Group Policy object. 

5.	Click **OK**.

6.	Right-click your new GPO, and then select **Edit**.

7.	Go to **Computer Configuration \> Policies \> Administrative Templates \> Windows Components \> Device Registration**. 

8.	Right-click **Register domain-joined computers as devices**, and then select **Edit**.

    > [!NOTE] 
    > This group policy template has been renamed from earlier versions of the Group Policy Management console. If you are using an earlier version of the console, go to **Computer Configuration \> Policies \> Administrative Templates \> Windows Components \> Workplace Join \> Automatically workplace join client computers**. 

9.	Select one of the following settings, and then click **Apply**:

    - **Disabled** - To prevent the automatic device registration
    - **Enabled** - To enable the automatic device registration

10.	Click **OK**.

You need to link the GPO to a location of your choice. For example, to set this policy for all domain-joined current devices in your organization, link the GPO to the domain. To do a controlled deployment, set this policy to domain-joined Windows current devices that belong to an organizational unit or a security group.

### Configuration Manager controlled deployment 

You can control the device registration behavior of your current devices by configuring the following client setting: **Automatically register new Windows 10 domain joined devices with azure Active Directory **


**To set the client setting**:

1.	Open **Configuration Manager**, and then go to **Cloud Services**.

2.	Under **Device Settings**, select one of the following settings for **Automatically register new Windows 10 domain joined devices with azure Active Directory**:

    - **No** - To prevent the automatic device registration
    - **Yes** - To enable the automatic device registration


3.	Click **OK**.
	

You need to link this client setting to a location of your choice. For example, to configure this client setting for all Windows current devices in your organization, link the client setting to the domain. To do a controlled deployment, you can configure the client setting to domain-joined Windows current devices that belong to an organizational unit or a security group.

> [!Important]
> While the above configuration takes care of existing domain joined Windows 10 devices, there is a potential for newly domain joining devices to still attempt to complete hybrid Azure AD join due to the potential delay in the actual application of group policy or Configuration Manager settings on the newly domain joined Windows 10 device. To avoid this, it is recommended that you create a new sysprep image (used as an example for a provisioning method) from a device that was never previously hybrid Azure AD joined and that already has the above group policy setting applied or Configuration Manager client setting applied. You must also use the new image for provisioning new computers that join your organization's domain. 

## Control Windows down-level devices

To register Windows down-level devices, you need to download and install Windows Installer package (.msi) from Download Center on the [Microsoft Workplace Join for non-Windows 10 computers](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53554) page.

You can deploy the package by using a software distribution system like System Center Configuration Manager. The package supports the standard silent install options with the quiet parameter. [System Center Configuration Manager](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/system-center-configuration-manager) Current Branch offers additional benefits from earlier versions, like the ability to track completed registrations.

The installer creates a scheduled task on the system that runs in the userâ€™s context. The task is triggered when the user signs in to Windows. The task silently joins the device with Azure AD with the user credentials after authenticating with Azure AD.


To control the device registration, you should deploy the Windows Installer package only to a selected group of Windows down-level devices. If you have verified that everything works as expected, you are ready to rollout the package to all down-level devices.
