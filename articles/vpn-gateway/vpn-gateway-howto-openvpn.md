# Configure OpenVPN for Azure point-to-site VPN Gateway (Preview)

This article helps you set up OpenVPN on Azure VPN Gateway. The article assumes that you already have a working point-to-site environment. If you do not, use the instructions in step 1 to create a point-to-site VPN.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This Public Preview is provided without a service level agreement and should not be used for production workloads. Certain features may not be supported, may have constrained capabilities, or may not be available in all Azure locations. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for details.

## <a name="vnet"></a>1. Create a point-to-site VPN

If you don't already have a functioning point-to-site environment, follow the instruction to create one. See [Create a point-to-site VPN](vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal.md) to create and configure a point-to-site VPN gateway with native Azure certificate authentication.

## <a name="cmdlets"></a>2. Install PowerShell cmdlets

Install the latest version of the Resource Manager PowerShell cmdlets. For more information about installing PowerShell cmdlets, see [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/overview). This is important because earlier versions of the cmdlets do not contain the current values that you need for this exercise.

## <a name="enable"></a>3. Enable OpenVPN on the gateway

Enable OpenVPN on your gateway. Make sure that the gateway is already configured for point-to-site (IKEv2 or SSTP) before running the following commands:

```powershell
$gw = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGateway -ResourceGroupName $rgname -name $name
Set-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGateway -VirtualNetworkGateway $gw -VpnClientProtocol OpenVPN
```
