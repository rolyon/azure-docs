# Create a Python web app in Azure App Service on Linux (Preview)

[App Service on Linux](app-service-linux-intro.md) provides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service using the Linux operating system. This quickstart shows how to deploy a Python app on top of the built-in Python image (Preview) in App Service on Linux using the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

You can follow the steps in this article using a Mac, Windows, or Linux machine.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart:

* <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Install Python 3.7</a>
* <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Install Git</a>

## Download the sample

In a terminal window, run the following commands to clone the sample application to your local machine, and navigate to the directory with the sample code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/python-docs-hello-world
cd python-docs-hello-world
```

## Run the app locally

Run the application locally so that you see how it should look when you deploy it to Azure. Open a terminal window and use the commands below to install the required dependencies and launch the built-in development server. 

```bash
# In Bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
FLASK_APP=application.py flask run

# In PowerShell
py -3 -m venv env
env\scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set-Item Env:FLASK_APP ".\application.py"
flask run
```

Open a web browser, and navigate to the sample app at `http://localhost:5000/`.

You see the **Hello World!** message from the sample app displayed in the page.

In your terminal window, press **Ctrl+C** to exit the web server.

## Create a web app

[!INCLUDE [Create app service plan](../../../includes/app-service-web-create-web-app-python-linux-no-h.md)]

Browse to the site to see your newly created web app with built-in image. Replace _&lt;app name>_ with your web app name.

```bash
http://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net
```

Here is what your new web app should look like:

 ```

## Browse to the app

Browse to the deployed application using your web browser.

```bash
http://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net
```

The Python sample code is running in a web app with built-in image.

**Congratulations!** You've deployed your first Python app to App Service on Linux.

## Update locally and redeploy the code

In the local repository, open the `application.py` file, and make a small change to the text in the last line:

```python
return "Hello Azure!"
```

Commit your changes in Git, and then push the code changes to Azure.

```bash
git commit -am "updated output"
git push azure master
```

Once deployment has completed, switch back to the browser window that opened in the **Browse to the app** step, and refresh the page.

## Manage your new Azure web app

Go to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">Azure portal</a> to manage the web app you created.

From the left menu, click **App Services**, and then click the name of your Azure web app.

![Portal navigation to Azure web app](./media/quickstart-python/app-service-list.png)

You see your web app's Overview page. Here, you can perform basic management tasks like browse, stop, start, restart, and delete.

The left menu provides different pages for configuring your app.

## Next steps

The built-in Python image in App Service on Linux is currently in Preview. You can create production Python apps using a custom container instead.
