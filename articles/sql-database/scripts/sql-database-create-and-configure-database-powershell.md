# Use PowerShell to create a single Azure SQL database and configure a firewall rule

This PowerShell script example creates an Azure SQL database and configures a server-level firewall rule. Once the script has been successfully run, the SQL Database can be accessed from all Azure services and the configured IP address. 

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]
[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-powershell.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-powershell.md)]

If you choose to install and use the PowerShell locally, this tutorial requires the Azure PowerShell module version 5.7.0 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable AzureRM` to find the version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps). If you are running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzureRmAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

## Sample script

[!code-powershell-interactive[main](../../../powershell_scripts/sql-database/create-and-configure-database/create-and-configure-database.ps1?highlight=13-14 "Create SQL Database")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```powershell
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName $resourcegroupname
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [New-AzureRmResourceGroup](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/new-azurermresourcegroup) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [New-AzureRmSqlServer](/powershell/module/azurerm.sql/new-azurermsqlserver) | Creates a logical server that hosts a database or elastic pool. |
| [New-AzureRmSqlServerFirewallRule](/powershell/module/azurerm.sql/new-azurermsqlserverfirewallrule) | Creates a firewall rule to allow access to all SQL Databases on the server from the entered IP address range. |
| [New-AzureRmSqlDatabase](/powershell/module/azurerm.sql/new-azurermsqldatabase) | Creates a database in a logical server as a single or a pooled database. |
