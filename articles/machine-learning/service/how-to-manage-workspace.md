# Create and manage Azure Machine Learning Workspaces

In this article, you'll create, view, and delete [**Azure Machine Learning Workspaces**](concept-azure-machine-learning-architecture.md#workspace) in the Azure portal for [Azure Machine Learning service](overview-what-is-azure-ml.md).  You can also create and delete workspaces [using the CLI](reference-azure-machine-learning-cli.md) or [with Python code](http://aka.ms/aml-sdk).

To create a workspace, you need an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Create a workspace 

[!INCLUDE [aml-create-portal](../../../includes/aml-create-in-portal.md)]

## View a workspace

1. In top left corner of the portal, select **All services**. 

1. In the **All services** filter field, type **Machine Learning Workspace**.

1. In the filter results, select **Machine Learning Workspace** to display a list of your workspaces.

1. Look through the list of workspaces found. You can filter based on subscription, resource groups, and locations.
