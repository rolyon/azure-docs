# Create a CI/CD pipeline for .NET with the Azure DevOps Project

Configure continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) for your .NET core or ASP.NET application with the **Azure DevOps Project**.  The Azure DevOps Project simplifies the initial configuration of an Azure DevOps Services build and release pipeline.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can get one free through [Visual Studio Dev Essentials](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/dev-essentials/).

## Sign in to the Azure portal

The Azure DevOps Project creates a CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps Services.  You can create a **new Azure DevOps Services** organization or use an **existing organization**.  The Azure DevOps Project also creates **Azure resources** in the **Azure subscription** of your choice.

1. Sign into the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Choose the **Create a resource** icon in the left navigation bar, then search for **DevOps Project**.  Choose **Create**.

## Select a sample application and Azure service

1. Select the **.NET** sample application.  The .NET samples include a choice of either the open-source ASP.NET framework or the cross-platform .NET Core framework.

1. Select the **.NET Core** application framework.  This sample is an ASP.NET Core MVC application. When you're done, choose **Next**.

1. **Web App on Windows** is the default deployment target.  Optionally, you can choose Web App on Linux or Web App for Containers.  The application framework, which you chose on the previous steps, dictates the type of Azure service deployment target available here.  Leave the default service, and then choose **Next**.

## Configure Azure DevOps Services and an Azure subscription 

1. Create a **new** free Azure DevOps Services organization or choose an **existing** organization.  Choose a **name** for your Azure DevOps project.  Select your **Azure subscription**, **location**, and choose a **name** for your application.  When you're done, choose **Done**.

1. In a few minutes, the **DevOps Project dashboard** loads in the Azure portal.  A sample application is set up in a repository in your Azure DevOps Services organization, a build executes, and your application deploys to Azure.  This dashboard provides visibility into your **code repository**, **Azure DevOps Services CI/CD pipeline**, and your **application in Azure**.  On the right side of the dashboard, select **Browse** to view your running application.

## Commit code changes and execute CI/CD

The Azure DevOps Project created a Git repository in your Azure DevOps Services organization or GitHub account.  Follow the steps below to view the repository and make code changes to your application.

1. On the left-hand side of the DevOps Project dashboard, select the link for your **master** branch.  This link opens a view to the newly created Git repository.

1. To view the repository clone URL, select **Clone** from the top right of the browser. You can clone your Git repository in your favorite IDE.  In the next few steps, you can use the web browser to make and commit code changes directly to the master branch.

1. On the left-hand side of the browser, navigate to the **Views/Home/index.cshtml** file.

1. Select **Edit**, and make a change to the h2 heading.  For example, type **Get started right away with the Azure DevOps Project** or make some other change.

1. Choose **Commit**, then save your changes.

1. In your browser, navigate to the **Azure DevOps Project dashboard**.  You should now see a build is in progress.  The changes you made are automatically built and deployed via an Azure DevOps Services CI/CD pipeline.

## Examine the Azure DevOps Services CI/CD pipeline

The Azure DevOps Project automatically configured a full Azure DevOps Services CI/CD pipeline in your Azure DevOps Services organization.  Explore and customize the pipeline as needed.  Follow the steps below to familiarize yourself with the Azure DevOps Services build and release pipelines.

1. Select **Build Pipelines** from the **top** of the Azure DevOps Project dashboard.  This link opens a browser tab and opens the Azure DevOps Services build pipeline for your new project.

1. Select the **ellipsis**.  This action opens a menu where you can start several activities such as queue a new build, pause a build, and edit the build pipeline.

1. Select **Edit**.

1. From this view, **examine the various tasks** for your build pipeline.  The build performs various tasks such as fetching sources from the Azure Repos Git repository, restoring dependencies, and publishing outputs used for deployments.

1. At the top of the build pipeline, select the **build pipeline name**.

1. Change the **name** of your build pipeline to something more descriptive.  Select **Save & queue**, then select **Save**.

1. Under your build pipeline name, select **History**.  You see an audit trail of your recent changes for the build.  Azure DevOps Services keeps track of any changes made to the build pipeline, and allows you to compare versions.

1. Select **Triggers**.  The Azure DevOps Project automatically created a CI trigger, and every commit to the repository creates a new build.  You can optionally choose to include or exclude branches from the CI process.

1. Select **Retention**.  Based on your scenario, you can specify policies to keep or remove a certain number of builds.

1. Select **Build and Release**, then choose **Releases**.  The Azure DevOps Project created an Azure DevOps Services release pipeline to manage deployments to Azure.

1. On the left-hand side of the browser, select the **ellipsis** next to your release pipeline, then choose **Edit**.

1. The release pipeline contains a **pipeline**, which defines the release process.  Under **Artifacts**, select **Drop**.  The build pipeline you examined in the previous steps produces the output used for the artifact. 

1. To the right-hand side of the **Drop** icon, select the **Continuous deployment trigger**.  This release pipeline has an enabled CD trigger, which executes a deployment every time there is a new build artifact available.  Optionally, you can disable the trigger, so your deployments require manual execution. 

1. On the left-hand side of the browser, select **Tasks**.  The tasks are the activities your deployment process performs.  In this example, a task was created to deploy to **Azure App service**.

1. On the right-hand side of the browser, select **View releases**.  This view shows a history of releases.

1. Select the **ellipsis** next to one of your releases, and choose **Open**.  There are several menus to explore from this view such as a release summary, associated work items, and tests.

1. Select **Commits**.  This view shows code commits associated with the specific deployment. 

1. Select **Logs**.  The logs contain useful information about the deployment process.  They can be viewed both during and after deployments.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can delete the Azure App service and related resources created in this quickstart by using the **Delete** function from the Azure DevOps Project dashboard.
