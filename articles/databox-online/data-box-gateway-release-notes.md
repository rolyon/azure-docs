## Known issues in Preview release

The following table provides a summary of known issues for the Data Box Gateway running preview release.

| No. | Feature | Issue | Workaround/comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1.** |Updates |The Data Box Gateway devices created in the earlier preview releases cannot be updated to this version. |Download the virtual disk images from the new release and configure and deploy new devices. For more information, go to [Prepare to deploy Azure Data Box Gateway](data-box-gateway-deploy-prep.md). |
| **2.** |Provisioned data disk |Once you have provisioned a data disk of a certain specified size and created the corresponding Data Box Gateway, you must not shrink the data disk. Attempting to shrink the disk results in a loss of all the local data on the device. | |
| **3.** |Refresh |In this release, you can refresh only one share at a time. | |
| **4.** |Rename |Rename of objects is not supported. |Contact Microsoft Support if this feature is crucial for your workflow. |
| **5.** |Copy| If a read-only file is copied to the device, the read-only property is not preserved. | |
| **6.** |Logs| Due to a bug in this release, you may see instances of error code 110 in *error.xml* with unrecognizable item names. | |
| **7.** |Upload | Due to a bug in this release, you may see instances of error code 2003 during the upload of specific files. | |
| **8.** |File types | The following Linux file types are not supported: character files, block files, sockets, pipes, symbolic links.  |Copying these files results in 0-length files getting created on the NFS share. These files remain in an error state and are also reported in *error.xml*. |
| **9.** |Deletion | Due to a bug in this release, if an NFS share is deleted, then the share may not be deleted. The share status will display *Deleting*.  |This occurs only when the share is using an unsupported file name. |
| **10.** |Refresh | Permissions and access control lists (ACLs) are not preserved across a refresh operation.  | |
| **11.** |Online help |The Help links in the Azure portal may not link to  documentation.|The Help links will work in the General Availability release. |
