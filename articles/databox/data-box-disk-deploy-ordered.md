# Tutorial: Order an Azure Data Box Disk (Preview)

Azure Data Box Disk is a hybrid cloud solution that allows you to import your on-premises data into Azure in a quick, easy, and reliable way. You transfer your data to solid-state disks (SSDs) supplied by Microsoft and ship the disks back. This data is then uploaded to Azure. 

This tutorial describes how you can order an Azure Data Box Disk. In this tutorial, you learn about:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Sign up for Data Box Disk
> * Order a Data Box Disk
> * Track the order
> * Cancel the order

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Data Box Disk is in preview. Review the [Azure terms of service for preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) before you order and deploy this solution. 
> - During preview, Data Box Disk can be shipped to customers in US, West and North Europe, Candana, and Australia. For more information, go to [Region availability](data-box-disk-overview.md#region-availability).

## Sign up 

Data Box Disk is in preview and you need to sign up for the service. Perform the following steps to sign up for Data Box service:

1. Sign into the Azure portal at: [https://aka.ms/azuredataboxfromdiskdocs](https://aka.ms/azuredataboxfromdiskdocs).
2. Pick the subscription that you want to enable for the preview. Answer the questions regarding data size, data residence country, time-frame, and data transfer frequency. Click **Sign me up!**.

14. In the **Shipping address** tab, provide your first and last name, name and postal address of the company and a valid phone number. Click **Validate address**. The service validates the shipping address for service availability. If the service is available for the specified shipping address, you receive a notification to that effect.

15. In the **Notification details**, specify email addresses. The service sends email notifications regarding any updates to the order status to the specified email addresses. 

    We recommend that you use a group email so that you continue to receive notifications if an admin in the group leaves.

16. Review the information **Summary** related to the order, contact, notification, and privacy terms. Check the box corresponding to the agreement to privacy terms.

17. Click **Order**. The order takes a few minutes to be created.

 
## Track the order

After you have placed the order, you can track the status of the order from Azure preview portal. Go to your order and then go to **Overview** to view the status. The portal shows the job in **Ordered** state. 

![Data Box Disk status ordered](media/data-box-disk-deploy-ordered/data-box-portal-ordered.png) 

If the disks are not available, you receive a notification. If the disks are available, Microsoft identifies the disks for shipment and prepares the disk package. During disk preparation, following actions occur:

- Disks are encrypted using AES-128 BitLocker encryption.  
- Disks are locked to prevent an unauthorized access to the disks.
- The passkey that unlocks the disks is generated during this process.

When the disk preparation is complete, the portal shows the order in **Processed** state.

Microsoft then prepares and dispatches your disks via a regional carrier. You receive a tracking number once the disks are shipped. The portal shows the order in **Dispatched** state.



## Cancel the order

To cancel this order, in the Azure preview portal, go to **Overview** and click **Cancel** from the command bar. 

You can only cancel when the disks are ordered and the order is being processed for shipment. Once the order is processed, you can no longer cancel the order.

To delete a canceled order, go to **Overview** and click **Delete** from the command bar.
