# Deploy a new simulated device

The Remote Monitoring and Device Simulation solution accelerators both let you define your own simulated devices. This article shows you how to deploy a customized chiller device type and a new lightbulb device type to the Device Simulation solution accelerator.

The steps in this article assume you've completed the [Create and test a new simulated device](iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-create-simulated-device.md) how-to guide and have the files that define the customized chiller and new lightbulb device types.

The steps in this how-to guide show you how to:

1. Use SSH to access the file system of the virtual machine that hosts the Device Simulation solution accelerator.

1. Configure Docker to load the device models from a location outside the Docker container.

1. Run a simulation using custom device model files.

To complete the steps in this how-to guide, you need an active Azure subscription.

If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To follow this how-to guide, you need:

- A deployed instance of the [Device Simulation solution accelerator](https://www.azureiotsolutions.com/Accelerators#solutions/types/DS).
- A local **bash** shell to run the `ssh` and `scp` commands. On Windows, an easy way to install **bash** is to install [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
- Your custom device model files, such as the ones described in [Create and test a new simulated device](iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-create-simulated-device.md).

[!INCLUDE [iot-solution-accelerators-access-vm](../../includes/iot-solution-accelerators-access-vm.md)]

## Configure Docker

In this section, you configure Docker to load the device model files from the **/tmp/devicemodels** folder in the virtual machine rather than from inside the Docker container. Run the commands in this section in a **bash** shell on your local machine:

1. Use SSH to connect to the virtual machine in Azure from your local machine. The following command assumes the public IP address of virtual machine **vm-vikxv** is **104.41.128.108** -- replace this value with the public IP address of your virtual machine from the previous section:

   ```sh
    ssh azureuser@104.41.128.108
    ```

    Follow the prompts to sign in to the virtual machine with the password you set in the previous section.

1. Configure the device simulation service to load the device models from outside the container. First open the Docker configuration file:

    ```sh
    sudo nano /app/docker-compose.yml
    ```

    Locate the settings for the **devicesimulation** container and edit the **volumes** setting as shown in the following snippet:

    ```yml
    # To mount custom device models, upload the files to the VM, edit and uncomment the following line:
          - /tmp/devicemodels:/app/webservice/data/devicemodels:ro
    # To mount a custom service configuration, create a custom file, edit and uncomment the following line:
    #     - /app/custom-device-simulation-appsettings.ini:/app/webservice/appsettings.ini:ro
    ```

    Save the changes.

1. Create the folders to store the JSON and script files:

    ```sh
    sudo mkdir -p /tmp/devicemodels/scripts
    ```

    Keep the **bash** window with your SSH session open.

1. Copy your custom device model files into the virtual machine. Run this command in another **bash** shell on the machine where you created your custom device models. First, navigate to the local folder that contains your device model JSON files. The following commands assume the public IP address of the virtual machine is **104.41.128.108** -- replace this value with the public IP address of your virtual machine. Enter your virtual machine password when prompted:

    ```sh
    scp *json azureuser@104.41.128.108:/tmp/devicemodels
    cd scripts
    scp *js azureuser@104.41.128.108:/tmp/devicemodels/scripts
    ```

1. Restart the device simulation Docker container to use the new device models. Run the following commands in the **bash** shell with the open SSH session to the virtual machine:

    ```sh
    sudo /app/start.sh
    ```

    If you want to see status of the running Docker containers and their container IDs, use the following command:

    ```sh
    docker ps
    ```

    If you want to see the log from the device simulation container, run the following command. Replace the container ID with the ID of your device simulation container:

    ```sh
    docker logs -f 5d3f3e78822e
    ```

## Run simulation

You can now run a simulation using your custom device models:

1. Launch your Device Simulation web UI from [Microsoft Azure IoT Solution Accelerators](https://www.azureiotsolutions.com/Accelerators#dashboard).

1. Use the web UI to configure and run a simulation using one of your custom device models.

1. When you run a simulation, click the **View IoT Hub metrics in the Azure portal** to monitor the simulation. Alternatively, you can use the following Azure CLI command to monitor the device to cloud traffic. Replace the name of the IoT hub with your hub name:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot hub monitor-events -n contoso-simulation9dc75
    ```

## Clean up resources

If you plan to explore further, leave the Device Simulation solution accelerator deployed.

If you no longer need the solution accelerator, delete it from the [Provisioned solutions](https://www.azureiotsolutions.com/Accelerators#dashboard) page, by selecting it, and then clicking **Delete Solution**.

## Next steps

This guide showed you how to deploy custom device models to the Device Simulation solution accelerator. The suggested next step is to learn more about the [device model schema](iot-accelerators-device-simulation-device-schema.md).
