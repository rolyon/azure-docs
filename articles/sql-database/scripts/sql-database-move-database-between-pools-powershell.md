# Use PowerShell to create elastic pools and move databases between elastic pools

This PowerShell script example creates two elastic pools and moves a database from one elastic pool into another elastic pool, and then moves a database out of an elastic pool to a single database compute size.

If you choose to install and use the PowerShell locally, this tutorial requires the Azure PowerShell module version 5.7.0 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable AzureRM` to find the version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps). If you are running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzureRmAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

## Sample script

[!code-powershell-interactive[main](../../../powershell_scripts/sql-database/move-database-between-pools-and-standalone/move-database-between-pools-and-standalone.ps1?highlight=17-18 "Move database between pools")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```powershell
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName $resourcegroupname
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [New-AzureRmResourceGroup](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/new-azurermresourcegroup) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [New-AzureRmSqlServer](/powershell/module/azurerm.sql/new-azurermsqlserver) | Creates a logical server that hosts a database or elastic pool. |
| [New-AzureRmSqlElasticPool](/powershell/module/azurerm.sql/new-azurermsqlelasticpool) | Creates an elastic pool within a logical server. |
| [New-AzureRmSqlDatabase](/powershell/module/azurerm.sql/new-azurermsqldatabase) | Creates a database in a logical server as a single or a pooled database. |
| [Set-AzureRmSqlDatabase](/powershell/module/azurerm.sql/set-azurermsqldatabase) | Updates database properties or moves a database into, out of, or between elastic pools. |
| [Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/remove-azurermresourcegroup) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
