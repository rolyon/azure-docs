# C# SDK quickstart

The Bing Custom Search SDK provides an easier programming model than the Bing Custom Search REST API. This section walks you through making your first Custom Search calls using the C# SDK.

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart, you need:

- A ready-to-use custom search instance. See [Create your first Bing Custom Search instance](quick-start.md).  
  
- A subscription key. You can get a subscription key when you activate your [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=bing-custom-search), or you can use a paid subscription key from your Azure dashboard (see [Cognitive Services API account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account)).  
  
- Visual Studio 2017 installed. If you donâ€™t already have it, you can download the **free** [Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).  
  
- The [NuGet Custom Search](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Search.CustomSearch/1.2.0) package installed. From the Solution Explorer in Visual Studio, right-click on your project and select `Manage NuGet Packages` from the menu. Install the `Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Search.CustomSearch` package.

Installing the NuGet Custom Search package also installs the following assemblies:

* Microsoft.Rest.ClientRuntime
* Microsoft.Rest.ClientRuntime.Azure
* Newtonsoft.Json



## Run the code

To run this example, follow these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio 2017.
  
2. Click the **File** menu, click **New**, **Project**, and then the **Visual C# Console Application** template.
  
3. Name your solution CustomSearchSolution and browse to the folder to put it in.
  
4. Click OK to create the solution.  
  
4. From the Solution Explorer, right-click on your project (it has the same name as the solution) and select `Manage NuGet Packages`. Click **Browse** in the NuGet Package Manager. Enter Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Search.CustomSearch in the search box and press enter. Select the package and click Install.  
  
4. Copy the following code into the Program.cs file. Replace **YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY** and **YOUR-CUSTOM-CONFIG-ID** with your subscription key and configuration ID.  
  
    ```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Linq;
    using Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Search.CustomSearch;

    namespace CustomSrchSDK
    {
        class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {

                var client = new CustomSearchAPI(new ApiKeyServiceClientCredentials("YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY"));

                try
                {
                    // This will look up a single query (Xbox).
                    var webData = client.CustomInstance.SearchAsync(query: "Xbox", customConfig: Int32.Parse("YOUR-CUSTOM-CONFIG-ID")).Result;
                    Console.WriteLine("Searched for Query# \" Xbox \"");

                    //WebPages
                    if (webData?.WebPages?.Value?.Count > 0)
                    {
                        // find the first web page
                        var firstWebPagesResult = webData.WebPages.Value.FirstOrDefault();

                        if (firstWebPagesResult != null)
                        {
                            Console.WriteLine("Number of webpage results {0}", webData.WebPages.Value.Count);
                            Console.WriteLine("First web page name: {0} ", firstWebPagesResult.Name);
                            Console.WriteLine("First web page URL: {0} ", firstWebPagesResult.Url);
                        }
                        else
                        {
                            Console.WriteLine("Couldn't find web results!");
                        }
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine("Didn't see any Web data..");
                    }
                }
                catch (Exception ex)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Encountered exception. " + ex.Message);
                }

                Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit...");
                Console.ReadKey();
            }

        }
    }
    ```  
  
5. Build and run (debug) the solution. 




## Breaking it down

After installing the NuGet Custom Search package, you need to add a using directive for it.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Search.CustomSearch;
```

Next, instantiate the custom search client, which you use to make search requests. Be sure to replace `YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY` with your key.

```csharp
var client = new CustomSearchAPI(new ApiKeyServiceClientCredentials("YOUR-CUSTOM-SEARCH-KEY"));
```

Now you can use the client to send a search request. Be sure to replace your `YOUR-CUSTOM-CONFIG-ID` with your instance's configuration ID (you can find the ID in the [Custom Search portal](https://www.customsearch.ai/)). This example searches for Xbox. Update as needed.

```csharp
var webData = client.CustomInstance.SearchAsync(query: "Xbox", customConfig: Int32.Parse("YOUR-CUSTOM-CONFIG-ID")).Result;
```

The `SearchAsync` method returns a `WebData` object. Use `WebData` to iterate through any `WebPages` that were found. This code finds the first webpage result and prints the webpage's `Name` and `URL`.

```csharp
//WebPages
if (webData?.WebPages?.Value?.Count > 0)
{
    // find the first web page
    var firstWebPagesResult = webData.WebPages.Value.FirstOrDefault();

    if (firstWebPagesResult != null)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Webpage Results#{0}", webData.WebPages.Value.Count);
        Console.WriteLine("First web page name: {0} ", firstWebPagesResult.Name);
        Console.WriteLine("First web page URL: {0} ", firstWebPagesResult.Url);
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Couldn't find web results!");
    }
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Didn't see any Web data..");
}

```
