# Azure Event Grid event schema for Container Registry

This article provides the properties and schema for Container Registry events.Â For an introduction to event schemas, see [Azure Event Grid event schema](event-schema.md).

## Available event types

Blob storage emits the following event types:

| Event type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Microsoft.ContainerRegistry.ImagePushed | Raised when an image is pushed. |
| Microsoft.ContainerRegistry.ImageDeleted | Raised when an image is deleted. |

## Example event

The following example shows the schema of an image pushed event: 

```json
[{
  "id": "831e1650-001e-001b-66ab-eeb76e069631",
  "topic": "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/<name>",
  "subject": "aci-helloworld:v1",
  "eventType": "ImagePushed",
  "eventTime": "2018-04-25T21:39:47.6549614Z",
  "data": {
    "id": "31c51664-e5bd-416a-a5df-e5206bc47ed0",
    "timestamp": "2018-04-25T21:39:47.276585742Z",
    "action": "push",
    "target": {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json",
      "size": 3023,
      "digest": "sha256:213bbc182920ab41e18edc2001e06abcca6735d87782d9cef68abd83941cf0e5",
      "length": 3023,
      "repository": "aci-helloworld",
      "tag": "v1"
    },
    "request": {
      "id": "7c66f28b-de19-40a4-821c-6f5f6c0003a4",
      "host": "demo.azurecr.io",
      "method": "PUT",
      "useragent": "docker/18.03.0-ce go/go1.9.4 git-commit/0520e24 os/windows arch/amd64 UpstreamClient(Docker-Client/18.03.0-ce \\\\(windows\\\\))"
    }
  },
  "dataVersion": "1.0",
  "metadataVersion": "1"
}]
```

The schema for an image deleted event is similar:

```json
[{
  "id": "f06e3921-301f-42ec-b368-212f7d5354bd",
  "topic": "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/<name>",
  "subject": "aci-helloworld",
  "eventType": "ImageDeleted",
  "eventTime": "2018-04-26T17:56:01.8211268Z",
  "data": {
    "id": "f06e3921-301f-42ec-b368-212f7d5354bd",
    "timestamp": "2018-04-26T17:56:00.996603117Z",
    "action": "delete",
    "target": {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json",
      "digest": "sha256:213bbc182920ab41e18edc2001e06abcca6735d87782d9cef68abd83941cf0e5",
      "repository": "aci-helloworld"
    },
    "request": {
      "id": "aeda5b99-4197-409f-b8a8-ff539edb7de2",
      "host": "demo.azurecr.io",
      "method": "DELETE",
      "useragent": "python-requests/2.18.4"
    }
  },
  "dataVersion": "1.0",
  "metadataVersion": "1"
}]
```
