## Run an upgrade

You can upgrade the Collector to the latest version without downloading the OVA again.

1. You download the latest upgrade package in the list below.
2. To ensure that the downloaded hotfix is secure, you open Administrator command window and run the following command to generate the hash for the ZIP file. The generated hash should match with the hash mentioned against the specific version:

	```C:\>CertUtil -HashFile <file_location> [Hashing Algorithm]```

    Example: **C:\>CertUtil -HashFile C:\AzureMigrate\CollectorUpdate_release_1.0.9.14.zip SHA256)**
3. Copy the zip file to the Collector appliance VM.
4. Right-click on the zip file > **Extract All**.
5. Right-click on **Setup.ps1** > **Run with PowerShell**, and follow the installation instructions.
