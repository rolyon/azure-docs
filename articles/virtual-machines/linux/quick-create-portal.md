# Quickstart: Create a Linux virtual machine in the Azure portal

Azure virtual machines (VMs) can be created through the Azure portal. This method provides a browser-based user interface to create VMs and their associated resources. This quickstart shows you how to use the Azure portal to deploy a Linux virtual machine (VM) in Azure that runs Ubuntu. To see your VM in action, you then SSH to the VM and install the NGINX web server.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Create SSH key pair

You need an SSH key pair to complete this quickstart. If you have an existing SSH key pair, this step can be skipped.

To create an SSH key pair and log into Linux VMs, run the following command from a Bash shell and follow the on-screen directions. For example, you can use the [Azure Cloud Shell](../../cloud-shell/overview.md) or the [Windows Substem for Linux](/windows/wsl/install-win10). The command output includes the file name of the public key file. Copy the contents of the public key file (`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) to the clipboard:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
```

For more detailed information on how to create SSH key pairs, including the use of PuTTy, see [How to use SSH keys with Windows](ssh-from-windows.md).

## Log in to Azure

Log in to the Azure portal at http://portal.azure.com

## Create virtual machine

1. Choose **Create a resource** in the upper left-hand corner of the Azure portal.

1. In the search box above the list of Azure Marketplace resources, search for and select **Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS** by Canonical, then choose **Create**.

1. In the **Basics** tab, under **Project details**, make sure the correct subscription is selected and then choose to **Create new** under **Resource group**. In the pop-up, type *myResourceGroup* for the name of the resource group and then choose **OK*.

1. Under **Instance details**, type *myVM* for the **Virtual machine name** and choose *East US* for your **Region**. Leave the other defaults.

1. Under **Administrator account**, select **SSH public key**, type your user name, then paste your public key into the text box. Remove any leading or trailing white space in your public key.

1. Under **Inbound port rules** > **Public inbound ports**, choose **Allow selected ports** and then select **SSH (22)** and **HTTP (80)** from the drop-down.

1. Leave the remaining defaults and then select the **Review + create** button at the bottom of the page.

	
## Connect to virtual machine

Create an SSH connection with the VM.

1. Select the **Connect** button on the overview page for your VM.

2. In the **Connect to virtual machine** page, keep the default options to connect by DNS name over port 22. In **Login using VM local account** a connection command is shown. Click the button to copy the command. The following example shows what the SSH connection command looks like:

    ```bash
    ssh azureuser@myvm-123abc.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com
    ```

3. Paste the SSH connection command into a shell, such as the Azure Cloud Shell or Bash on Ubuntu on Windows to create the connection. 

## Install web server

To see your VM in action, install the NGINX web server. To update package sources and install the latest NGINX package, run the following commands from your SSH session:

```bash
# update packages
sudo apt-get -y update

# install NGINX
sudo apt-get -y install nginx
```

When done, `exit` the SSH session and return to the VM properties in the Azure portal.


## View the web server in action

With NGINX installed and port 80 open to your VM, the web server can now be accessed from the internet. Open a web browser, and enter the public IP address of the VM. The public IP address can be found on the VM overview page, or at the top of the *Networking* page where you add the inbound port rule.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can delete the resource group, virtual machine, and all related resources. To do so, select the resource group for the virtual machine, select **Delete**, then confirm the name of the resource group to delete.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you deployed a simple virtual machine, created a Network Security Group and rule, and installed a basic web server. To learn more about Azure virtual machines, continue to the tutorial for Linux VMs.
