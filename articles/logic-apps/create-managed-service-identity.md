# Access resources and authenticate as managed identities in Azure Logic Apps

To access resources in other Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants 
and authenticate your identity without signing in, you can create a 
[managed identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md) 
that your logic app uses instead of your credentials. Azure manages this 
identity for you, and helps secure your credentials because you don't 
have to provide or rotate secrets. This article shows how to create 
and use a managed identity for your logic app. For more information, see 
[Manage identities for Azure resources](../app-service/app-service-managed-service-identity.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Managed identities for Azure resources is the 
> replacement name for the service formerly
> known as Managed Service Identity (MSI).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription, or if you don't have a subscription, 
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/" target="_blank">sign up for a free Azure account</a>.

* The logic app where you want to use the managed identity. 
If you don't have a logic app, see 
[Create your first logic app workflow](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md).

## Create managed identity

You can create or enable a managed identity for your logic app 
through the Azure portal, Azure Resource Manager templates, 
or Azure PowerShell. 

### Azure portal

To create a managed identity for your logic app through the Azure portal, 
turn on the **Register with Azure Active Directory** setting in your 
logic app's workflow settings.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), 
open your logic app in Logic App Designer.

1. Follow these steps: 

   1. On the logic app menu, under **Settings**, 
   select **Workflow settings**. 

   1. Under **Managed service identity** > 
   **Register with Azure Active Directory**, choose **On**.

   1. When you're done, choose **Save** on the toolbar.

      ![Turn on managed identity setting](./media/create-managed-service-identity/turn-on-managed-service-identity.png)

      Azure now shows these properties and values 
      for your logic app's managed identity:

      ![GUIDS for principal ID and tenant ID](./media/create-managed-service-identity/principal-tenant-id.png)

      | Property | Value | Description | 
      |----------|-------|-------------| 
      | **Principal ID** | <*principal-ID-GUID*> | A Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) that represents the logic app in an Azure AD tenant | 
      | **Tenant ID** | <*Azure-AD-tenant--ID-GUID*> | A Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) that represents the Azure AD tenant where your logic app is now a member. Inside the Azure AD tenant, the service principal has the same name as the logic app instance. | 
      ||| 

### Deployment template

To automate creating and deploying Azure resources such as logic apps, 
you can set up Azure Resource Manager templates. For more information, see 
[Create and deploy logic apps with Azure Resource Manager templates](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-deploy-azure-resource-manager-templates.md). 

To create a managed identity for your logic app through a template, 
add the **identity** element and **type** property to your logic 
app workflow definition in your deployment template. These settings 
indicate that Azure creates and manages this identity for your logic app:

```json
"identity": {
    "type": "SystemAssigned"
}
```

For example, your logic app might look like this version:

```json
{
   "apiVersion": "2016-06-01", 
   "type": "Microsoft.logic/workflows", 
   "name": "[variables('logicappName')]", 
   "location": "[resourceGroup().location]", 
   "identity": { 
      "type": "SystemAssigned" 
   }, 
   "properties": { 
      "definition": { 
         "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Logic/schemas/2016-06-01/workflowdefinition.json#", 
          "actions": {}, 
          "parameters": {}, 
          "triggers": {}, 
          "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0", 
          "outputs": {} 
     }, 
     "parameters": {}, 
     "dependsOn": [] 
}
```

When Azure creates your logic app, that logic app's 
workflow definition includes these additional properties:

```json
"identity": {
    "type": "SystemAssigned",
    "principalId": "<principal-ID-GUID>",
    "tenantId": "<Azure-AD-tenant-ID>-GUID"
}
```

| Property | Value | Description | 
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **principalId** | <*principal-ID-GUID*> | A Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) that represents the logic app in the Azure AD tenant | 
| **tenantId** | <*Azure-AD-tenant--ID-GUID*> | A Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) that represents the Azure AD tenant where the logic app is now a member. Inside the Azure AD tenant, the service principal has the same name as the logic app instance. | 
|||

## Access resources with managed identity

After you create a managed identity for your logic app, you can 
[give that identity access to other resources](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/howto-assign-access-portal.md). You can then use that managed identity for authentication, just like any other 
[service principal](../active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals.md). 

For example, suppose you've already set up a logic app 
with a managed identity that has access to another resource. 
You can now add an HTTP action so your logic app can send 
an HTTP request or call to that resource. 

1. In your logic app, add the **HTTP** action. 

1. Provide the necessary details for that action, 
such as the request **Method** and **URI** location 
for the resource you want to call.

1. In the HTTP action, choose **Show advanced options**. 

1. From the **Authentication** list, select **Managed Service Identity**, 
which then shows the **Audience** property for you to set:

   ![Select "Managed Service Identity"](./media/create-managed-service-identity/select-managed-service-identity.png)

1. Continue building the logic app the way you want.

## Remove managed identity

To disable a managed identity on your logic app, 
you can follow the steps similar to how you created 
the identity through the Azure portal, Azure Resource 
Manager deployment templates, or Azure PowerShell. 

When you delete your logic app, 
Azure automatically removes your logic app's 
system-assigned identity from Azure AD.

### Azure portal

1. In Logic App Designer, open your logic app.

1. Follow these steps: 

   1. On the logic app menu, under **Settings**, 
   select **Workflow settings**. 
   
   1. Under **Managed service identity**, choose **Off** 
   for the **Register with Azure Active Directory** property.

   1. When you're done, choose **Save** on the toolbar.

      ![Turn off managed identity setting](./media/create-managed-service-identity/turn-off-managed-service-identity.png)

### Deployment template

If you created the logic app's managed identity with 
an Azure Resource Manager deployment template, set the 
`"identity"` element's `"type"` property to `"None"`. 
This action also deletes the principal ID from Azure AD. 

```json
"identity": {
    "type": "None"
}
```
